<p class="hanging"><i>Except the theatre of actual Warfare, no spot known to
man furnishes such facilities for the practice of combined
strategy, tactics and logistics as does the surface of the
Chess-board.</i></p>

<p>To those familiar with the Science of Strategetics, it
needs no proof that ability to play a good game at Chess,
indicates the possession of faculties common to all great
military commanders.</p>

<p>At a certain point, the talent of Morphy for Chess-play
and the talent of Napoleon for Warfare become merged;
and beyond this point, their methods of thought and of
action are identical.</p>

<p>Opportunity to display, and in most spectacular
fashion, their singular and superlative genius, was not
wanting to either.</p>

<p>But unlike the ferocious Corsican, whose “only desire
is to find myself on the battlefield,” the greatest of all
Masters at Chess, found in the slaughter of his fellow-creatures
no incentive sufficient to call forth those unsurpassed
strategetical powers, which recorded Chess-play
shows he possessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>From this sameness of talent, common to the great
Chess-player and the great military commander, arises
the practical utility of the Royal Game.</p>

<p>For by means of Chess-play, one may learn and practice
in their highest interpretation, mental and physical
processes of paramount importance to the community
in time of extreme peril.</p>

<p>From such considerations and for the further reason
that in a true Republic all avenues to greatness are
open to merit, scientific Chess-play should be intelligently
and systematically taught in the public schools.
“A people desirous of liberty will entrust its defense to
none but themselves,” says the Roman maxim, and in
crises, woe to that land where the ruler is but a child in
arms, and where the disinclination of the people towards
its exercise is equalled by their unfamiliarity with the
military habit.</p>

<p>Despite the ethics of civilization, the optimism of the
“unco guid” and the unction even of our own heart’s
deep desire, there seems no doubt but that each generation
will have its wars.</p>

<p>“<i>Pax perpetua</i>,” writes Leibnitz, “exists only in
God’s acre.” Here on earth, if seems that men forever
will continue to murder one another for various reasons;
all of which, in the future as in the past, will be good and
sufficient to the fellow who wins; and this by processes
differing only in neatness and despatch.</p>

<p>Whether this condition is commendable or not, depends
upon the point of view. Being irremediable, such
phase of the subject hardly is worth discussing. However,
the following by a well-qualified observer, is interesting
and undeniably an intelligent opinion, viz.:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<h3>From the essay on “WAR,” read by Prof. John Ruskin
at Woolwich, (Eng.) Military Academy.</h3>

<p>“All the pure and noble arts of Peace are founded on
War; no great Art ever rose on Earth, but among a
nation of soldiers.</p>

<p>“As Peace is established or extended the Arts decline.
They reach an unparalleled pitch of costliness, but lose
their life, enlist themselves at last on the side of luxury
and corruption and among wholly tranquil nations,
wither utterly away.</p>

<p>“So when I tell you that War is the foundation of all
the Arts, I mean also that it is the foundation of all the
high virtues and faculties of men.</p>

<p>“It was very strange for me to discover this and very
dreadful&mdash;but I saw it to be quite an undeniable fact.</p>

<p>“We talk of Peace and Learning, of Peace and Plenty,
of Peace and Civilization; but I found that those were
not the words which the Muse of History coupled together;
but that on her lips the words were&mdash;Peace and
Selfishness, Peace and Sensuality, Peace and Corruption,
Peace and Death.</p>

<p>“I found in brief, that all great nations learned their
truth of word and strength of thought in War; that they
were nourished in War and wasted in Peace; taught by
War and deceived by Peace; trained by War and betrayed
by Peace; that they were born in War and expired
in Peace.</p>

<p>“Creative, or foundational War, is that in which
the natural restlessness and love of contest among men,
is disciplined into modes of beautiful&mdash;though it may be
fatal&mdash;play; in which the natural ambition and love of
Power is chastened into aggressive conquest of surrounding
evil; and in which the natural instincts of self-defence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
are sanctified by the nobleness of the institutions which
they are appointed to defend.</p>

<p>“For such War as this all men are born; in such War
as this any man may happily die; and forth from such
War as this have arisen throughout the Ages, all the
highest sanctities and virtues of Humanity.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That our own country may escape the common lot of
nations, is something not even to be hoped.</p>

<p>Defended by four almost bottomless ditches, nevertheless
it is a certainty that coming generations of Americans
must stand in arms, not only to repel foreign aggression,
but to uphold even the integrity of the Great Republic;
and with the hand-writing of coming events flaming on
the wall, posterity well may heed the solemn warning of
by-gone centuries:</p>

<p>“<i>As man is superior to the brute, so is a trained and
educated soldier superior to the merely brave, numerous
and enthusiastic.</i>”</p>

remote and in my judgment, not to be dreaded; but the consequence
of lacking one is inevitable ruin.”&mdash;Washington.</i></p>

<p><i>“The first care of the sage should be to discover the true
character of his pupils. By his questions he should assist
them to explain their own ideas and by his answers he
should compel them to perceive their falsities. By accurate
definitions he should gradually dispel the incongruities in
their earlier education and by his subtlety in arousing their
doubts, he should redouble their curiosity and eagerness
for information; for the art of the instructor consists in
inciting his pupils to that point at which they cannot endure
their manifest ignorance.</i></p>

<p><i>“Many, unable to undergo this trial and confounded
by offended self-conceit and lacking the fortitude to sustain
correction, forsake their master, who should not be eager to
recall them. Others who learn from humiliation to distrust
themselves should no longer have snares spread for their
vanity. The master should speak to them neither with the
severity of a censor nor with the haughtiness of a sophist,
nor deal in harsh reproaches nor importunate complaints;
his discourse should be the language of reason and friendship
in the mouth of experience.”&mdash;Socrates.</i></p>

writers who, as their writings show, are ignorant even of
the rudiments of military art and science. Of course a
certain license in expression of thought is not to be denied
the layman; he cannot be expected to talk with the exactness
of the man who knows. At the same time there
is a limit beyond which the non-technical man passes
at his peril, and this limit is reached when he poses as a
critic and presumes to dogmatize on matters in regard to
which he is uninformed.</i></p>

<p>The fanciful conjectures of such people, well are
illustrated by the following editorial <i>faux pas</i>, perpetrated
by a leading metropolitan daily, viz.:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Everyone knows now that a future war between states
having similar and substantially equal equipments will
be a different affair from any war of the past; characterized
by a different order of generalship and a radically novel
application of the principles of strategy and tactics.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>Many in the struggle to obtain their daily bread, are
tempted to essay the unfamiliar, and for a stipulated
wage to pose as teachers to the public.</p>

<p>Such always will do well to write modestly in regard
to sciences which they have not studied and of arts
which they never practiced, and especially in future
comments on Military matters, such people may profit
by the appended modicum of that ancient history, which
newspaper men as a class so affect to despise, and in
regard to which, as a rule, they are universally and
lamentably, ignorant.</p>

<p>What orders of Generalship can exist in the future,
different from those which always have existed since
war was made, viz.: good generalship and bad generalship?</p>

<p>Ability properly to conduct an army is a concrete
thing; it does not admit of comparison. Says Frederic
the Great:</p>

<p>“There are only two kinds of Generals&mdash;those who
know their trade and those who do not.”</p>

<p>Hence, “a different order of Generalship,” suggested
by the editorial quoted, implies either a higher or a lesser
degree of ability in the “general of the future”; and as
obviously, it is impossible that he can do worse than
many already have done, it is necessary to assume that
the commander of tomorrow will be an improvement
over his predecessors.</p>

<p>Consequently, to the military mind it becomes of
paramount interest to inquire as to the form and manner
in which such superiority will be tangibly and visibly
manifested, viz.:</p>

<p>Will the general of the future be a better general than
Epaminondas, Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar, Gustavus
Adolphus, Turenne, Eugene, Frederic, Washington,
Napoleon, Von Moltke?</p>

<p>Will he improve upon that application of the principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
of strategy and tactics to actual warfare which comes
down to us of today, stamped with the approval of these
superlative military geniuses?</p>

<p>Will the general of the future know a better way for
making war than acting against the enemy’s communications?</p>

<p>Will he devise a better method of warfare than that
whose motive is the concentration of a superior force upon
the strategetic objective?</p>

<p>Will the processes of his prime logistic operations be
preferable to those of men who won their victories before
their battles were fought, by combining with their
troops the topography of the country, and causing
rivers and mountains to take the place of corps d’armee?</p>

<p>Will the general of the future renounce as obsolete
and worthless that military organization founded centuries
before the Christian Era, by the great Theban,
Epaminondas, the father of scientific warfare; that
system adopted by every captain of renown and which
may be seen in its purity in the greater military establishments
from the days of Rome to the present Imperial
North German Confederation?</p>

<p>Will the general of the future renounce as obsolete
and worthless that system of Minor Tactics utilized by
every man who has made it his business to conquer the
World? Will he propose to us something more perfect
than the primary formation of forces depicted in Plate
XIII of the Secret Strategical Instructions of Frederic II?</p>

<p>Will the general of the future renounce as obsolete
and worthless those intricate, but mathematically exact,
evolutions of the combined arms, which appertain to the
Major Tactics of men who are remembered to this day
for the battles that they won?</p>

<p>Will he invent processes more destructive than those
whereby Epaminondas crushed at Leuctra and Mantinea
the power of Sparta, and the women of Lacedaemon saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
the smoke of an enemy’s camp fire for the first time in six
hundred years?</p>

<p>Than those whereby Alexander, a youth of eighteen,
won Greece for his father at Chaeronea and the World
for himself at Issus and Arbela? Than those whereby
Hannibal destroyed seriatim four Roman armies at
Trebia, Thrasymenus, Cannae and Herdonea?</p>

<p>Will he find out processes more sudden and decisive
than those whereby Caesar conquered Gaul and Pompey
and the son of Mithridates, and which are fitly described
only in his own language; “Veni, vidi, vici”?</p>

<p>What will the general of the future substitute for the
three contiguous sides of the octagon whereby Tamerlane
the Great with his 1,400,000 veterans at the Plains
of Angora, enveloped the Emperor Bajazet and 900,000
Turks in the most gigantic battle of record?</p>

<p>Will he eclipse the pursuit of these latter by Mizra,
the son of Tamerlane, who with the Hunnish light
cavalry rode two hundred and thirty miles in five days
and captured the Turkish capital, the Emperor Bajazet,
his harem and the royal treasure?</p>

<p>Will he excel Gustavus Adolphus, who dominated
Europe for twenty years, and Turenne, the military Atlas
who upheld that magnificent civilization which embellishes
the reign of Louis XIV?</p>

<p>Will he do better than Prince Eugene, who victoriously
concluded eighteen campaigns and drove the Turks out
of Christendom?</p>

<p>Will he discover processes superior to those whereby
Frederic the Great with 22,000 troops destroyed at
Rosbach a French army of 60,000 regulars in an hour and
a half, at the cost of three hundred men; and at Leuthern
with 33,000 troops, killed, wounded or captured 54,000
out of 93,000 Austrians, at a cost of 3,900 men?</p>

<p>Will he improve on those processes whereby Napoleon
with 40,000 men, destroyed in a single year five Austrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
armies and captured 150,000 prisoners? Will he improve
on Rivoli, Austerlitz, Jena, Friedland, Wagram,
Dresden, and Ligny?</p>

<p>Will the general of the future renounce as obsolete
and worthless that system of Grand Tactics, by means
of which the mighty ones of Earth have swept before
them all created things?</p>

<p>Will his system surpass in grandeur of conception and
exactness of execution the march of Alexander to the
Indus? Will he reply to his rival’s prayers for peace and
amity as did the great Macedonian; “There can be but
one Master of the World”; and to the dissuasions of his
friend; “So would I do, were I Parmenio”?</p>

<p>Will he do things more gigantic than Hannibal’s
march across the Alps?</p>

<p>Than the operation of Alesia by Caesar; where the
Romans besieging one Gallic army in a fortified city, and
themselves surrounded by a second Gallic army, single
handed destroyed both? Than the circuit of the Caspian
Sea by the 200,000 light cavalry of Tamerlane, a
feat of mountain climbing which never has been duplicated?
Than that marvelous combination of the
principles of tactics and of field fortification, whereby in
the position of Bunzelwitz, Frederic the Great, with
55,000 men, successfully upheld the last remaining prop
of the Prussian nation, against 250,000 Russian and
Austrian regular troops, commanded by the best generals
of the age?</p>

<p>Will he conceive anything more scientific and artistic
than the manoeuvre of Trenton and Princeton by
Washington? Than the capture of Burgoyne at Saratoga
and Cornwallis at Yorktown? Than the manoeuvres
of Ulm, of Jena, of Landshut? Than the manoeuvres
of Napoleon in 1814? Than the manoeuvre of Charleroi
in 1815, declared by Jomini to be Napoleon’s masterpiece?
Will he excel the manoeuvres of Kutosof and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
Wittsengen in 1812-13 and of Blucher on Paris in 1814
and on Waterloo in 1815; each of which annihilated for
the time being the military power of France?</p>

<p>Will he devise military conceptions superior to those
whereby Von Moltke overthrew Denmark in six hours,
Austria in six days, and France in six weeks?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sapient race of quill-drivers ever has hugged to its
breast many delusions; some of which border upon the
outer intellectual darkness. One of these delusions is
that most persistently advertised, least substantial, but
forever darling first favorite of timid and inexperienced
minds: “<i>The pen is mightier than the sword.</i>”</p>

<p>Explanation of the invincible ignorance of the penny-a-liner
is simple, viz.:</p>

<p>Of the myriad self-appointed educators to the public,
few are familiar even with the rudimentary principles of
Military Science and almost none are acquainted even
with the simplest processes of Strategetic Art. Hence,
like all who discourse on matters which they do not
understand, such writers continually confound together
things which have no connection.</p>

<p>Ignorant of war and the use of weapons; bewildered by
the prodigious improvements in mechanical details,
they immoderately magnify the importance of such improvements,
oblivious to the fact that these latter relate
exclusively to elementary tactics and in no way affect
the system of Strategy, Logistics, and the higher branches
of Tactics.</p>

<p>Of such people, the least that can be said and that in
all charity, is, that before essaying the role of the
pedagogue, they should endeavor to grasp that most
obvious of all truths:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>A man cannot teach what he never has learned.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>Says Frederic the Great: “Improvements and new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
discoveries in implements of warfare will be made continually;
and generals then alive must modify tactics to
comply with these novelties. But the Grand Art of
taking advantage of topographical conditions and of the
faulty disposition of the opposing forces, ETERNALLY
WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED in the military
system.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Naturally, the student now is led to inquire:</p>

<p>What then is this immutable military system? What
are its text books, where is it taught and from whom is it
to be learned?</p>

<p>In answer it may be stated:</p>

<p>At the present day, private military schools make no
attempt to teach more than elementary tactics. Even
the Governmental academy curriculum aims little higher
than the school of the battalion.</p>

<p>Scientific Chess-play begins where these institutions
leave off, and ends at that goal which none of these
institutions even attempt to reach.</p>

<p>Chess teaches to conduct campaigns, to win battles,
and to move troops securely and effectively in the
presence of and despite the opposition of an equal or
superior enemy.</p>

<p>Military schools graduate boys as second-lieutenants
commanding a platoon. Chess graduates Generals, able
to mobilize Corps d’armee, whatever their number or
location; to develop these into properly posted integers
of a grand Strategic Front and to manoeuvre and operate
the army as a Strategetic Unit, in accordance to the laws
of the Strategetic art and the principles of the Strategetic
science.</p>

<p>By precept and by actual practice, Chess teaches what
is <i>NOT</i> taught in any military school&mdash;that least understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
and most misunderstood; that best guarded and
most invaluable of all State Secrets&mdash;</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>By authority indisputable, the ex-cathedra dictum of the
greatest of the Great Captains, we have been informed that
the higher processes of the military system, eternally will
remain unchanged.</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><i>As a necessary corollary, it follows that these processes
always have been and always will be comprehended and
employed by every great Captain.</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Equally, it is self-evident, that capability to comprehend
these higher processes, united with ability properly to
utilize them to win battles and campaigns, constitutes
genius for Warfare.</i></p>

<p>Moreover, we are further informed by the same unimpeachable
authority, that so irresistible is genius for
warfare, that united to courage, it is formidable beyond
the united financial and military resources of the State.
In corroboration of this, we have the testimony of well-qualified
judges. Says the Count de Saxe:</p>

<p>“Unless a man is born with talent for war and this
talent is brought to perfection, it is impossible for him
to be more than an indifferent general.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In these days, more or less degenerate from the
soldierly standpoint, the fantastic sophistries of Helvetius
have vogue, and most people believe book-learning
to be all-in-all.</p>

<p>Many are so weak-minded, as really to believe, that
because born in the Twentieth Century, they necessarily
are the repository of all the virtues, and particularly of
all the knowledge acquired by their ancestors from remotest
generations. Few seem to understand that the
child, even of ultra-modern conditions, is born just as
ignorant and often invincibly so, as were the sons of
Ham, Shem and Japhet, and most appear to be unaware,
that:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Only by intelligent reflection upon their own experience
and upon the experiences of others, can one acquire knowledge.</i></p>

<p>The triviality of crowding the memory with things
that may or may not be true, is the merest mimicry of
education.</p>

<p>Real education is nothing more than the fruit of experience;
and he who acts in conformity to such knowledge,
alone is wise. Thus to act, implies ability to
comprehend. But there are those in whom capability
is limited; hence, all may not be wise who wish to be so,
and these necessarily remain through life very much as
they are born.</p>

<p>The use of knowledge would be infinitely more certain,
if our understanding of its accurate application were as
extensive as our needs require. We have only a few
ideas of the attributes of matter and of the laws of
mechanics, out of an infinite number of secrets which
mankind never can hope to discover. This renders our
feeble adaptations in practice of the knowledge we
possess, oftimes inadequate for the result we desire;
and it seems obvious that if Nature had intended man
to attain to the superlative, she would have endowed
him with intelligence and have communicated to him
information, infinitely superior to that we possess.</p>

<p>The universal blunder of mankind arises from an
hallucination that all minds are created equal; and that
by mere book-learning, <i>i.e.</i>, simply by memorizing
what somebody says are facts it is possible for any man
to attain to superior and even to superlative ability.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such profoundly, but utterly mis-educated people,
not unnaturally may inquire, by what right speaks the
eminent warrior previously quoted. These properly
may be informed in the words of Frederic the Great:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>The Count de Saxe is the hero of the bravest action ever
done by man.</i>” viz.,</p>

</div>

<p>A great battle was raging.</p>

<p>Within a magnificent Pavilion in the centre of the
French camp, the King, the nobility and the high Ecclesiastics
of the realm were grouped about a plain iron cot.</p>

<p>Prone upon this cot, wasted by disease, lay the Count
de Saxe, in that stupor which often precedes and usually
presages dissolution.</p>

<p>The last rites of the Church had been administered,
and the assemblage in silence and apprehension, awaited
the approach of a victorious enemy and the final gasp of a
general who had never lost a battle.</p>

<p>The din of strife drawing nearer, penetrated the coma
which enshrouded the soul of the great Field-Marshal.</p>

<p>Saxe opened his eyes. His experienced ear told him
that his army, routed and disordered, was flying before
an exultant enemy.</p>

<p>The giant whose pastime it was to tear horseshoes in
twain with his bare hands and to twist nails into
corkscrews with his fingers, staggered to his feet, hoarsely
articulating fierce and mandatory ejaculations.</p>

<p>Hastily clothed, the Count de Saxe was placed in a
litter and borne out of his pavilion into that chaos
of ruin and carnage which invariably accompanies a lost
battle. Around him, behind and in front, swarmed his
broken battalions and disorganized squadrons; while in
pursuit advanced majestically in solid column, the
triumphant English.</p>

<p>Saxe demanded his horse and armor.</p>

<p>Clad in iron and supported in the saddle on either
hand, this modern Achilles galloped to the front of his
army; then, at the head of the Scotch Guards, the Irish
Brigade, and French Household troops, Saxe in person,
led that series of terrific hand-to-hand onslaughts which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
drove the English army from the field of battle, and
gained the famous victory of Fontenoy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Furthermore,” declares this illustrious Generalissimo
of Louis XIV;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>It is possible to make war without trusting anything
to accident; this is the highest point of skill and perfection
within the province of a general.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>“Most men,” writes Vergetius, “imagine that strength
and courage are sufficient to secure victory. Such are
ignorant that when they exist, stratagem vanquishes
strength and skill overcomes courage.”</p>

<p>In his celebrated work, <i>Institutorum Rei Militaris</i>,
that source from whence all writers derive their best
knowledge of the military methods of the ancients; and
by means of which, he strove to revive in his degenerate
countrymen that intelligent valor which distinguishes
their great ancestors&mdash;the famous Roman reiterates this
solemn warning:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Victory in war depends not on numbers, nor on
courage; skill and discipline only, can ensure it.”</p>

</div>

<p>The emphasis thus laid by these great warriors on
genius for warfare is still further accentuated by men
whose dicta few will dispute, viz.,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The understanding of the Commander,” says Frederic
the Great, “has more influence on the outcome of the
battle or campaign, than has the prowess of his troops.”</p>

</div>

<p>Says Napoleon:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The general is the head, the whole of an army. It
was not the Roman army that subjugated Gaul, it was
Caesar; nor was it the Carthagenian army that made
the Republic tremble to the gates of Rome, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Hannibal; it was not the Macedonian army which
reached the Indus, it was Alexander; it was not the
French army which carried war to the Weser and the
Inn, it was Turenne; it was not the Prussian army which
for seven years defended Prussia against the three strongest
powers of Europe, it was Frederic the Great.”</p>

</div>

<p>From such opinions by men whose careers evince
superlative knowledge of the subject, it is clear, that:</p>

<ul>
<li>I. <i>There exists a system of Strategetics common to all
great commanders</i>;</li>
<li>II. <i>That understanding of this system is shown by the
skillful use of it</i>;</li>
<li>III. <i>That such skill is derived from innate capability</i>;</li>
<li>IV. <i>That those endowed by Nature with this talent,
must bring their gifts to perfection, by intelligent study</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So abstruse are the processes of this greatest of all
professions, that comprehension of it has been evidenced
by eleven men only, viz.:</p>

<p>Epaminondas, Alexander, Caesar, Hannibal, Gustavus
Adolphus, Turenne, Eugene, Frederic, Washington,
Napoleon, Von Moltke.</p>

<p>Comprehension of this system can be attained, only
by innate capability brought to perfection by intelligent
study of the words and achievements of these great
Captains.</p>

<p>For life is so short and our memories in general so
defective, that we ought to seek instruction only from
the purest sources.</p>

<p>None but men endowed by Nature with the military
mind and trained in the school of the great Captains, are
able to write intelligently on the acts and motives of
generals of the first order. All the writings of mere
literati relative to these uncommon men, no matter how
excellent such authors may be, never can rise to anything
more than elegant phraseology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>It is of enlightened critics, such as the former, that the
youthful student always is first in need. Such will
guide him along a road, in which he who has no conductor
may easily lose himself. They will correct his
blunders considerately, recollecting that should these be
ridiculed or treated with severity, talent might be stifled
which might hereafter bloom to perfection.</p>

<p>It is a difficult matter to form the average student,
and to impart to him that degree of intelligent audacity
and confident prudence which is requisite for the proper
practice of the Art of Strategetics.</p>

<p>To secure proficiency, the student from the beginning
must cheerfully submit himself to a mental discipline,
which properly may be termed severe; in order to make
his faculties obedient to his will.</p>

<p>Secondly, he must regularly exercise these faculties,
in order to make them active and to acquire the habit of
implicitly conforming to the laws of the Art; to make
himself familiar with its processes, and to establish in
his mind that confidence in its practice which can come
only through experience.</p>

<p>The student daily should exercise his mind in the
routine of deployments, developments, evolutions, manoeuvres,
and operations, both on the offensive and on
the defensive. These exercises should be imprinted on
the memory by closely reviewing the lesson of the previous
day.</p>

<p>Even with all this severe and constant effort, time is
necessary for practical tactics to become habitual; for
the student must become so familiar with these movements
and formations that he can execute them instantly
and with precision.</p>

<p>To acquire this degree of perfection, much study is
necessary; it is a mistake to think otherwise. But this
study is its own sufficient reward, for the student soon
will find that it has extended his ideas, and <i>that he is
beginning to think in the GREAT</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time the student should thoroughly
instruct himself in military history, topography, logic,
mathematics, and the science of fortification. With
all of these the strategist must be familiar.</p>

<p>But his chief aim must be to perfect his judgment and
to bring it to the highest degree of broadness and
exactness.</p>

<p>This is best done by contemplation of the works of the
Great Masters.</p>

<p>The past history of Chess-play, is the true school for
those who aspire to precedence in the Royal Game. It is
their first duty to inform themselves of the processes of
the great in every age, in order to shun their errors and
to avail of their methods.</p>

<p>It is essential to grasp that system of play common to
the Masters; to pursue it step by step. Particularly is
it necessary to learn that he who can best deduce consequences
in situations whose outcome is in doubt, is
the competitor who will carry off the prize from others
who act less rationally than himself.</p>

<p>Especially, should the student be wary in regard to
what is termed chess analysis, as applied to the so-called
“openings” and to the mid-game. Most chess analysts
are compilers of falsities occasionally interspersed with
truth. Among the prodigious number of variations
which they pretend to establish or refute, none may be
implicitly relied on in actual play; few are of value
except for merely elementary purposes, and many are
fallacies fatal to the user.</p>

<p>The reason for this is: whenever men invited by curiosity,
seek to examine circumstantially even the less
intricate situations on the Chess-board, they at once
become lost in a labyrinth abounding in obscurities and
contradictions. Those, who ignorant of the synthetic
method of calculation, are compelled to depend upon
their analytic powers, quickly find that these, on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of the number of unknown quantities, are utterly
inadequate.</p>

<p>Any attempt to calculate the true move in Chess-play
by analysis, other than in situations devoid of unknown
quantities, is futile.</p>

<p>Yet it is of such folly that the mediocre mind is most
enamoured. Content with seeing much, it is oblivious
to what it cannot see; and the analytical system consists
merely in claiming that there is nothing to see, other
than what it does see.</p>

<p>This is that slender reed upon which the so-called
“chess-analyst” hangs his claims, oblivious to the basic
truth that in analysis, unless all is known, nothing is
known.</p>

<p>Many delude themselves to the contrary and strive to
arrive at correct conclusions without first having arranged
clearly before their minds all the facts.</p>

<p>Hence, their opinions and judgments, being founded in
ignorance of all the facts, are to that extent defective;
and their conclusions necessarily wrong.</p>

<p>Through action taken upon incomplete knowledge, men
are beguiled into error; and it is to such unreason that
most human catastrophes are to be attributed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Most of those who attempt to write on Strategetics,
and whether applied to Chess-play or to Warfare, very
quickly are compelled to seek refuge in vague phrases;
in order to conceal their uncertain grasp on the subject
discussed. The uninformed believe in them, because of
their reputation, and are satisfied that the thing is so,
without understanding <i>WHY</i>.</p>

<p>Words intended to convey instruction, should not be
used except in their proper meaning. Each word should
be defined for the student and its use regulated. The
true use of words being established, there is no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
danger from a play upon them; or, from different and
confused ideas annexed to them, either by the persons
who read, or who employ them.</p>

<p>By means of this warning, the student easily may
detect the empty mouthings of enthusiastic inexperience,
and equally so, the casuistries of the subtle expert; who
often uses language merely to conceal from youthful
talent, knowledge which if imparted, might be fatal to
his domination.</p>

<p>As the student progresses toward proficiency, he, sooner
or later, will come to realize, that of all disgusting things,
to a mind which revolts at nonsense, reasoning ill is
the worst.</p>

<p>It is distressing, to be afflicted with the absurdities of
men, who, victims of the fancy, confound enthusiasm
with capability and mistake mania for talent. The
world is full of such people, who, in all honesty thinking
themselves philosophers, are only visionaries enamoured
of their own lunatic illusions.</p>

<p>The true discipline for the student who aspires to
proficiency at Chess-play, is, in every succeeding game,
to imitate more closely the play of the Great Masters;
and to endeavor to take his measures with more attention
and judgment than in any preceding.</p>

<p>Every player at Chess has defects; many have very
great ones. In searching for these one should not treat
himself tenderly, and when examining his faults, he should
grant himself no quarter.</p>

<p>Particularly should the student cultivate confidence
in and rigidly adhere to the standard of skill, as interpreted
by that immutable System of Chess-play, of which
Morphy is the unapproachable and all-sufficient exponent.</p>

<p>Observing the lack of method displayed by the incompetent
Chess-commander, the student of this system
will remark with astonishment, the want of plan and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the entire absence of co-operation between the various
Chessic corps d’armee, which under such leadership are
incapable of a general effort.</p>

<p>How dense is such a leader in the selection of a project,
how slow and slovenly in its execution; how many opportunities
does he suffer to escape him and how many
enormous faults does he not commit? To such things,
the numerically weaker but more skillful opponent, often
is indebted for safety and ultimately for success.</p>

<p>One who is opposed by such blockheads, necessarily
must gain advantages continually; for conduct so opposite
to all the laws of the Art, is, in itself, sufficient to
incur ruin. It is for such negligence on his own part
that one often has cause bitterly to reproach himself.
But such errors, especially on the part of great players,
are exemplary lessons for the student, who from them
may learn to be more prudent, circumspect, and wise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Those who make a mere pastime of Chess, who have
no desire for the true benefit of the game, do not deserve
information.</p>

<p>Such people are more numerous than may be supposed.
They have few coherent ideas and are usually influenced
by mere chatter and by writers whose sole excuse is
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>These players at the game cannot benefit by example.
The follies of others afford them no useful lesson. Each
generation of such “wood-shifters,” has blindly followed
in the footsteps of those preceding and daily is guilty of
errors which times innumerable have been fully exposed.</p>

<p>It is the darling habit of such folk to treat the great
things in Chess with levity and to dignify those insignificant
matters which appertain to the game when
used as a plaything.</p>

<p>Such people are merely enthusiastic; usually they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
equally frivolous. They do everything from fancy,
nothing from design. Their zeal is strong, but they can
neither regulate nor control it.</p>

<p>Such bear about their Chessic disabilities in their
character. Inflated in good fortune, groveling in adversity,
these players never attain to that sage contemplation,
which renders the scientific practice of
Chess so indescribably beautiful.</p>

<p>There is another class of Chess-players who from mere
levity of mind are incapable of steadily pursuing any
fixed plan; but who overturn, move by move, even such
advantages as their good fortune may have procured.
There are others, who, although possessed of great vivacity
of mind and eager for information, yet lack that
patience necessary to receive instruction.</p>

<p>Lastly, there are not a few whose way of thinking and
the validity of whose calculations, depend upon their
good or ill digestion.</p>

<p>It is in vain that such people endeavor to divine
things beyond their understanding. Hence it is, that
among those incapable of thought, or too indolent for
mental effort, the game proceeds in easy fashion until
routine is over. Afterward, at each move, the most
probable conjecture passes for the best reason and
victory ultimately rests with him whose blunders are
least immediately consequential.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Understanding of high art is dispensed only to the
few; the great mass neither can comprehend nor enjoy it.
In spite of the good natured Helvetius, all are not wise
who wish to be so and men ever will remain what Nature
made them. It is impossible for the stream to rise
higher than its source.</p>

<p>“The progress of human reason,” writes the great
Frederic, “is more slow than is imagined; the true cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of which is that most men are satisfied with vague
notions of things and but few take time for examination
and deep inquiry.</p>

<p>“Some, fettered by prejudice from their infancy, wish
not, or are unable to break their chains; others, delighting
in frivolity know not a word of mathematics and
enjoy life without allowing their pleasures to be interrupted
by a moment of reflection. Should one thinking
man in a thousand be discovered it will be much; and
it is for him that men of talent write.</p>

<p>“The rest naturally are offended, for nothing so enrages
the mediocre mind as to be compelled to admit to
itself its own inferiority. Consequently, they consign
book, author, and reader conjointly to Satan. So much
easier is it to condemn than to refute, or to learn.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The early success of many young students does not
permit them to observe that they often have departed
from the rules of the Art. As they have escaped
punishment for their errors, they remain unacquainted
with the dangers to which they were exposed. Constant
good fortune finally makes them over-confident and
they do not suspect it necessary to change their measures,
even when in the presence of an able foe.</p>

<p>Thus, the youthful tyro, inconsiderate, inconsistent,
and turbulent, and oblivious to the innumerable dangers
by which he is surrounded, plays his pieces hither and
thither, as fancy and inclination dictate, culling bouquets
of the most gorgeous flowers of the imagination; thoughtless
of the future and perfectly happy because he cannot
reflect.</p>

<p>To reason exactly, the student first must rid his mind
of all preconceived notions; he must regard the matter
under consideration as a blank sheet of paper, upon
which nothing is to be written save those things which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
by the processes of logic and demonstration, are established
as facts.</p>

<p>There is much difference between the Art of Logic
and mere conjecture.</p>

<p>The calculations of arithmeticians, though rigorous and
exact, are never difficult; because they relate to known
quantities and to the palpable objects of nature. But
when it is required to argue from combining circumstances,
the least ignorance of uncertain and obscure
facts breaks the chain and we are deceived every moment.</p>

<p>This is no defect of the understanding, but error
arising from plausible ideas, which wear the face of and
are too quickly accepted for truth. A long chapter can
be written on the different ways in which men lose
themselves in their conjectures. Innumerable examples
of this are not wanting, and all because they have
suffered themselves to be hurried away and thus to be
precipitate in drawing their conclusions.</p>

<p>The part that the General, whether in Chess-play or in
Warfare, has to act, always is more difficult because he
must not permit himself the least mistake, but is bound
to behave with prudence and sagacity throughout a
long series of intricate processes. A single false deduction,
or a movement of the enemy unintelligible to a
commander, may lead him to commit an irremediable
error; and in cases wherein the situation is beyond
comprehension, his ignorance is invincible.</p>

<p>For however extensive the human mind may be, it
never is sufficiently so to penetrate those minute combinations
necessary to be developed in order to foresee
and regulate events, the sequence, utility and even
existence of which, depend upon future contingencies.</p>

<p>Incidents which are past, can be explained clearly,
because the reasons therefor are manifest. But men
easily deceive themselves concerning the future, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
by a veil of innumerable and impenetrable secondary
causes, is concealed from the most prying inspection.</p>

<p>In such situations, how puerile are the projects even
of the greatest Strategist. To him, as much as to the
tyro, is the future hidden; he knows not what shall
happen, even on the next move. How then may he
foresee those situations which secondary causes later
may produce?</p>

<p>Circumstances most often oblige him to act contrary
to his wishes; and in the flux and reflux of fortune, it is the
part of prudence to conform to system and to act with
consistency. It is impossible to foresee all events.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“It is not possible,” writes the Count de Saxe, “to
establish a system without first being acquainted with
the <i>principles</i> that must necessarily support it.”</p>

<p>In corroboration of this is the opinion of Frederic the
Great:</p>

<p>“Condemned by my unfortunate stars to philosophies
on contingencies and on probabilities I employ my
whole attention to examine the <i>principle</i> on which my
argument must rest and to procure all possible information
on that point. Deprived of such precaution, the
edifice I erect, wanting a base, would fall like a house of
cards.”</p>

<p>Everyone who does not proceed on principle, is inconsistent
in his conduct. Equally so, whenever the
principle on which one acts is false, <i>i.e.</i>, does not apply
to the existing situation; all deductions based thereon, if
applied to the existing situation, necessarily are false.</p>

<p>“Those principles which the Art of Warfare prescribes,
never should be departed from,” writes Frederic
the Great, “and generals rigidly should adhere to those
circumspections and never swerve from implicit obedience
to laws, upon whose exact observance depends the
safety of their armies and the success of their projects.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the student will clearly see that all other calculations,
though never so ingeniously imagined, are of
small worth in comparison with comprehension of the
use of Strategetic principles. By means of these latter,
we are taught to control the raging forces which dominate
in the competitive arts and to compel obedience from
friend and foe alike.</p>

<p>“To the shame of humanity it must be confessed,”
writes Frederic the Great, “that what often passes for
authority and consequence is mere assumption, used as a
cloak to conceal from the layman the extreme of official
indolence and stupidity.</p>

<p>“To follow the routine of service, to be busied concerning
food and clothing, and to eat when others eat, to
fight when others fight, are the whole warlike deeds of
the majority and constitute what is called having seen
service and grown grey in arms.</p>

<p>“The reason why so many officers remain in a state
of mediocrity, is because they neither know, nor trouble
themselves to inquire into the causes either of their
victories or defeats, although such causes are exceedingly
real.”</p>

<p>In this connection, writes Polybius, the friend and
biographer of Hannibal:</p>

<p>“Having made ourselves masters of the subject of
Warfare, we shall no longer ascribe success to Fortune
and blindly applaud mere conquerors, as the ignorant do;
but we shall approve and condemn from Principle and
Reason.”</p>

<p>To the Chess-student nothing can be more conclusive
than the following:</p>

<p>“My success at Chess-play,” writes Paul Morphy, “is
due to rigid adherence to fixed rules and Principles.”</p>

<h2>GRAND RECONNAISSANCE</h2>

<div class="quote">

<p><i>“In every situation the principal strategical requirements
must clearly be defined and all other things must be subordinated
to these considerations.”&mdash;Frederic the Great.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p><i>“One should seek to obtain a knowledge of causes, rather
than of effects; and should endeavor to reason from the
known, to the unknown.”&mdash;Euclid.</i></p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="hanging"><i>The province of Grand Reconnaissance is exactly to determine
the relative advantages and disadvantages in time,
numbers, organization, topography, mobility and position,
which appertain to hostile armies contained in the same
strategetic plane; and to designate those Corps d’armee
by which such advantages are materially expressed.</i></p>

<p>Those processes which appertain to the making of
Grand Reconnaissance, necessarily are argumentative;
inasmuch as all the facts never are determinate.</p>

<p>Consequently, talent of the highest order is required
for the deducing of conclusions which never can be based
upon exact knowledge, and which always must contemplate
the presence of numerous unknown quantities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The responsibilities inherent to Grand Reconnaissance
never are to be delegated to, nor thrust upon subordinates.
Scouts, spies, and informers of every kind,
have their manifold and proper uses, but such uses
never rise above furnishing necessary information in
regard to topographical, tactical, and logistic details.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-chief alone is presumed to possess
knowledge and skill requisite to discern what strategetically
is fact and what is not fact; and to ascribe to
each fact its proper place and sequence.</p>

<p>Lack of military talent and of Strategetic knowledge,
never is more strikingly shown than by negligence or
inability in this regard.</p>

<p>Incompetents, ignorant of this truth, and oblivious to
its importance, devolve such vital responsibility upon
subordinates; and later, these legalized murderers
palliate the slaughter of their troops and the national
shame by publicly reprimanding men serving at shillings
per month, for failing in a service, which were the latter
able to perform, would entitle them to the gold epaulets
and general’s pay, of which their commander is the
unfit recipient.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Knowledge of the number, organization, position and
movements of the enemy’s troops is the basic element
for correct calculation in campaign and battle.</p>

<p>Such things to be accurately estimated must be
closely inspected. All speculation and all conjecture in
regard to these matters is but frivolity.</p>

<p>It is by being precipitate and hasty in making such
conclusions, that men are deceived, for to judge rightly
of things before they become clearly shown is most
difficult.</p>

<p><i>To act on uncertainty is WRONG.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>We do not know all the facts and a single iota of light
later on may oblige us to condemn that which we previously
have approved.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the making of Grand Reconnaissance, one always
must be wary of placing too much confidence in appearances
and in first impressions. Especially must
care be taken not to magnify the weaknesses of the
hostile army, nor the efficacy of the kindred position.</p>

<p>Also, one never should underrate:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. The talents of the opposing commander; nor</li>
<li>2. The advantages possessed by the opposing army:
  <ul>
    <li>(a) In numbers,</li>
    <li>(b) In organization,</li>
    <li>(c) In position,</li>
    <li>(d) In topography,</li>
    <li>(e) In time,</li>
    <li>(f) In mobility.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It is a first essential, constantly to note the movements
of the enemy, in order to detect his plans and the exact
location of his corps.</p>

<p>These things are the only reliable guides for determining
the true course of procedure. It must be left to the
enemy to show by his movements and the posts which
he occupies, the measures he projects for the future, and
until these are known, it is not proper to <i>ACT</i>. Hence:</p>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>All movements of Corps Offensive should be governed by
the POSITION of the hostile army, and all movements
of Corps Defensive should be governed by the MOVEMENTS
of the hostile army.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the enemy begins a movement, his intentions
become clear. It is then possible to make precise
calculations.</p>

<p>But be not hasty to build conclusions upon uncertain
information and do not take any resolutions until certain
what are the numbers, the position, the objectives, and
the projects of the enemy.</p>

<p>However interesting an undertaking may appear, one
should not be seduced by it while ill-informed of the
obstacles to be met and the possibility of not having
sufficient force in the theatre of action.</p>

<p>Chimerical schemes should be abandoned at their
inception. Reason, instead of extravagancies of the
fancy, always must be the guide. Men, most courageous,
often undertake fearful difficulties, but impracticable
things they leave to lunatics.</p>

<p>In all situations, one must beware of venturing beyond
his depth. It is wiser to keep within the limits
which the knowledge we possess shall prescribe.</p>

<p>Especially in crises, one must proceed most cautiously
until sure information is acquired; for over-haste is
exceedingly dangerous, when exact knowledge is lacking
of the enemy’s numbers, position, and movements.</p>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>Situations always should be contemplated as they EXIST,
never as they OUGHT to be, or, perhaps, MAY be.</i></p>

<p>In every important juncture, each step must be profoundly
considered; as little as possible should be left to
chance.</p>

<p>Particularly, must one never be inflated and rendered
careless and negligent by success; nor made spiritless and
fearful by reverses. At all times the General should see
things only as they are and attempt what is dictated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
that Strategetic Principle which dominates the given
situation. Fortune often does the rest.</p>

<h4>FIRST EXAMPLE.</h4>

<p class="example">(From the <i>New York Journal</i>, Dec. 26, 1899
By <b>Franklin K. Young</b>.)</p>

<p>“The position of the British armies is deplorable.</p>

<p>“With the single exception of Gen. Buller’s force, the
situation of these bodies of British troops, thus unfortunately
circumstanced, is cause for the greatest
anxiety.</p>

<p>“Strong indications point to a grand offensive movement
on the part of the Boers, with the object of terminating
the war in one campaign and by a single blow.</p>

<p>“True, this movement may be but a feint, but if it be
a true movement, it is difficult to over-estimate the
gravity of the situation of the British in South Africa.</p>

<p>“For if this movement is a true military movement, it
shows as clearly as the sun in the sky to those who know
the Strategetic Art, that the Boer armies are in transition
from the defensive to an offensive plan of campaign, with
the purpose of capturing DeArr and from thence advancing
in force against the chief British depot, Capetown.”</p>

<p>The United States War Department, <i>Report on the
British-Boer War</i>, published June 14, 1901, contains the
following:</p>

<p class="example">(By <b>Capt. S. L’H. Slocum</b>, December 25, 1899.
U. S. Military Attache with the British Army.)</p>

<p>“I consider the present situation to be the most
critical for the English forces, since hostilities began.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Should the Boers assume offensive operations, the English
armies with their long and thinly guarded lines of
communication, would be placed in great jeopardy.”</p>

<p class="example">(By <b>Chas. S. Goldmann</b>, war correspondent with
Gen. Buller and Lord Roberts in the South African
Campaign. MacMillan &amp; Co., 1902.)</p>

<p>“Had the defence (of Cape Colony) been entrusted
to less capable hands than those of Gen. French, who,
with a mere handful of troops succeeded not only in
checking the Boer advance, but in driving them back on
Colesberg, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the
enemy would have been able to push on south and west
to Craddock and Hex River range and thus bring about a
state of affairs which might have shaken British rule in
South Africa to its foundation.”</p>

<h4>SECOND EXAMPLE.</h4>

<p class="example">(<i>Boston Globe</i>, Jan. 12, 1900. By <b>Franklin K. Young</b>.)</p>

<p>“Lord Roberts’ first object will be the rescue of Lord
Methuen’s army now blockaded near Magersfontein by
Gen. Conje.</p>

<p>“As the first step to effect this, the British commander-in-chief
at once and with all his force, will occupy the
line from Naauwpoort to De Arr. There, he will await
the arrival of twenty-two transports now en route from
England.</p>

<p>“With these reinforcements, he will advance directly
to the Modder River by the route previously taken by
Lord Methuen.”</p>

<p class="example">(By <b>Chas. S. Goldmann</b>, Sp. Cor. British Army.)</p>

<p>“Slow to recognize their opportunities, the enemy were
still in the midst of preparation, when Gen. French
reached De Arr. Meanwhile a detachment under Major
McCracken occupied Naauwpoort, to which place
thirty days’ supplies for 3000 men and 1100 animals
had been ordered.</p>

<p>“In the ten weeks of fighting which ensued, prior
to the arrival of the British main army, Gen. French by
his skillful tactics held a powerful force of Boers at bay,
checked their descent into the southern part of the
colony, defeated their attempt to display the Vierkleur
across the cape peninsular, and materially influenced,
if not absolutely determined, the entire future of the
campaign.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p class="example">(By <b>Chas. S. Goldmann</b>, Sp. Cor. with British Army.)</p>

<p>“Arriving at Capetown on Jan. 10, Lord Roberts
decided that the line of march should lead by way of
Bloemfontein to Pretoria, initiating the operation by
the concentration of large forces on the Modder River,
forming there an advanced base.”</p>

<h4>THIRD EXAMPLE.</h4>

<p class="example">(<i>Boston Globe</i>, Jan. 21, 1900. By <b>Franklin K. Young</b>.)</p>

<p>“It is plain that when the Boers took position at Colenso
they prepared their plan for the protection of their
flanks; to deny this would be to assume that men who
had displayed superb military sagacity were ignorant
of the simplest processes of warfare.</p>

<p>“What that plan is will be unfolded very rapidly
should Gen. Buller attempt to pierce the line of Boer
vedettes posted upon the Spion Kop and concealing as
near as can be determined from the present meagre facts,
either the Second, or the Fourth Ambuscade.</p>

<p>“In either case it signifies that the Boers are confident
of annihilating Gen. Buller’s army if it should cross the
Tugela.</p>

<p>“About this time the Boers are watching Gen. Warren
and his command and watching him intently. Something
may happen to him.”</p>

<p class="example">(<i>London Times</i>, Jan. 22, 1900.)</p>

<p>“On Friday, Jan. 19, Gen. Warren began a long,
circuitous march to the westward for the purpose of
turning the right of the Boer position.</p>

<p>“This attempt was abandoned on account of the long
ridge running from Spion Kop being occupied by the
Boers in such strength as to command the entire route.</p>

<p>“Saturday, Jan. 20, Gen. Warren, having crossed the
Tugela River with the bulk of his troops, ordered a
frontal attack. Our men behaved splendidly under a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>

<h4>FOURTH EXAMPLE.</h4>

<p class="example">(<i>Boston Globe</i>, Feb. 16, 1900, by <b>Franklin K. Young</b>.)</p>

<p>“Lord Roberts’ communications for nearly two hundred
miles are exposed to the attack of an enemy, who
at any moment is liable to capture and destroy his supply
and ammunition trains and to reduce the British army
to a condition wherein it will be obliged to fight a battle
under most disadvantageous circumstances.”</p>

<p class="example">(From United States War Department <i>Report on the
British Boer War</i>. By <b>Capt. S. L’H. Slocum</b>, U. S.
Attache with British Army.)</p>

<p>“Feb. 15, 1900. The main supply park of the army
was attacked by the enemy near Watervale Drift.</p>

<p>“This park consisted of one hundred ox-wagons containing
rations and one hundred more wagons filled with
ammunition. One hundred and fifty of these wagons
and three thousand oxen were captured by the Boers.</p>

<p>“The loss of these rations and munitions was a most
serious blow. Lord Roberts was here confronted by a
crisis which would have staggered and been the undoing
of many commanders-in-chief placed as he was.</p>

<p>“He was in the enemy’s country, cut off from his base
of supplies on the railroad and with an unknown number
of the enemy in his rear and upon his line of communication.
His transport was nearly all captured and his army
was suddenly reduced to three days full rations on the
eve of a great movement and the country afforded no food
whatever. The crisis still further developed when a courier
brought the report that the Boers were in position at
Watervale Drift and commanding the ford with artillery.”</p>

<h4>FIFTH EXAMPLE.</h4>

<p class="example">(<i>Boston Globe</i>, Feb. 25, 1900. By <b>Franklin K. Young</b>.)</p>

<p>“There is reason to believe that should worse come to
worse, the Boer Army, should it be compelled to abandon
its position, will be able to save its personnel by a rapid
flight across the Modder. Of course, in this case, the
Boers would lose their supplies and cannon.”</p>

<p class="example">(From United States War Department, <i>Report on the
British Boer War</i>. By <b>Capt. S. L’H. Slocum</b>, U. S.
Attache, with British Army.)</p>

<p>“The enemy, under Cronje, with all his transport was
in all practical effect surrounded, although by abandoning
his wagons and supplies, a large number of the Boers
undoubtedly could have escaped.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p class="example">(<i>Boston Sunday Times</i>, March, 1900. By <b>Franklin
K. Young</b>.)</p>

<p>“Cronje’s conduct was heroic and imbecile in the extreme.
As the commander on the ground he is entitled
to all the glory and must assume all the blame. One of
the ablest of the Boer generals, he is the only one in
the whole war to make a mistake.</p>

<p>“Cronje’s first duty was to decide whether he should
stand or run; he decided to run, which was proper, but
having so decided he should have run at once and not
have stopped running until safe on the north bank of
the Vaal River.</p>

<p>“Properly he sent his siege guns and trains off to the
north across the Vaal and improperly held his position
in force on the British front, instead of withdrawing his
personnel after his material.</p>

<p>“This blunder, like all blunders of a commander-in-chief,
quickly produced blunders by his subordinates.
Commander Ferrera permitted French to get around
Cronje’s left flank without a battle. The presence of
this force on his rear cut Cronje off from his natural
line of retreat across the Vaal and compelled him to
flee toward Bloemfontein.</p>

<p>“Even now Cronje was all right; he easily and brilliantly
out-manoeuvred the British and gained the protection
of the Modder River. But a second time he
blundered. Instead of first executing Ferrera and then
abandoning everything and devoting all his efforts to
saving his men, he neglected an obvious and imperative
military duty and clung to his slow-moving cannon and
wagons.</p>

<p>“Finally he took position on the Modder and resolved
to fight the whole British army. This was fatal.</p>

<p>“Then for the fourth time he blundered. Having
made his decision to fight he should not have surrendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to the British on the anniversary of Majuba Hill. On
the contrary, surrounded by the mightiest army the
British empire ever put in the field and enveloped in
the smoke of a hundred cannon, Cronje, upon a rampart
formed by his dead army and with his last cartridge
withstanding the destroyers of his country, would have
presented to posterity a more spectacular and seemingly
a more fitting termination of the career of the Lion of
South Africa.”</p>

own and of the enemies’ troops.</p>

<p>“He must examine which army has the better weapons,
which is the better trained and disciplined; superior in
condition and most resolute in emergencies.</p>

<p>“He must note whether himself or the adversary has
the superior infantry, cavalry or artillery, and particularly

<p>“If a general finds himself superior to his enemy he

tactical area made up of corresponding geometric or sub-geometric
symbols.</i></p>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>Advantage in Organization determines the choice of a
prospective battlefield; and the latter always should be composed
of those tactical areas which permit of the fullest
exercise of the powers peculiar to kindred corps d’armee.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Notions most mistaken prevail in regard to the Pawns
and Pieces of the Chessboard.</p>

<p>To suppose that the Chessmen <i>per se</i> may be utilized
to typify the different arms of the military service is a
fallacy.</p>

<p>Many unfamiliar with the technicalities of Strategetic
Science delude themselves that the Pawns, on account
of their slow and limited movements properly are to be
regarded as Infantry; that the Knights because topped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
by horses’ heads thereby qualify as light Cavalry; the
Bishops, for reasons unknown, often are held to represent
Artillery; the Rooks, because of their swift, direct and
far-reaching movements are thought to duplicate heavy
Cavalry; while the Queen, in most of these unsophisticated
philosophies, is supposed to constitute a Reserve.</p>

<p>Nothing can be further from the truth than such assumptions.</p>

<p>As a fundamental of military organization applied
to Chessplay, each Chesspiece typifies in itself a complete
Corps d’armee. Each of these Chessic corps d’armee is
equal to every other in strength, but all differ, more or
less, in construction and in facilities, essential to the
performance of diverse and particular duties.</p>

<p>Thus it is that while every Chesspiece represents a
perfectly appointed and equally powerful body of troops,
these corps d’armee in Chessplay as in scientific warfare
are not duplicates, except to others of their own class.
Each of these corps d’armee is made up of Infantry,
Cavalry and Artillery in correct proportion to the service
they are to perform and such proportions are determined
not by simple arithmetic, but by those deployments,
developments, evolutions, and manoeuvres, which such
corps d’armee is constructed promptly and efficiently to
execute.</p>

<p>The Chessmen, therefore, do not as individuals represent
either infantry, cavalry or artillery.</p>

<p>But in the same manner as the movements of troops
over the surface of the earth, exemplify the attributes of
the three kindred grand columns in the greater logistics
of a campaign; so do those peculiarities which appertain
to the moves of the different Chesspieces exemplify the
action of the three chief arms of the military service;
either singly or in combination against given points
in given times, in the evolutions of the battlefield, viz.:</p>

<h4>CHESSIC CORPS D’ARMEE.</h4>

<p>The <i>Corps d’armee of the Chessboard</i> are divided into
two classes: viz.:</p>

<ul>
<li>I. Corps of Position.</li>
<li>II. Corps of Evolution.</li>
</ul>

<h4>CORPS D’ARMEE OF POSITION.</h4>

<div class="quote">

<p><i>“The Pawns are the soul of Chess; upon their good or bad
arrangement depends the gain or loss of the game.”&mdash;Philidor.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>The eight Pawns</i>, by reason of their limited movements,
their inability to move backward and the peculiarity
of their offensive and defensive powers, are best
adapted of the Chesspieces to perform those functions
which in the Military Art appertain to Corps of Position.</p>

<p>Each Corps of Position has its particular and designated
Point of Mobilization and of Development, which
differ with the various Strategic Fronts.</p>

<p>Upon each Corps of Position devolves the duties of
maintaining itself as a consistent integer of the established,
or projected kindred Pawn Integral; as a
possible kindred Promotable Factor and as a Point of
Impenetrability upon the altitude of an opposing Pawn.</p>

<p>Corps of Position take their individual appelation
from their posts in a given formation, viz.:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Base Corps.</li>
<li>2. Pivotal Corps.</li>
<li>3. Minor Vertex Corps.</li>
<li>4. Minor Corps Aligned.</li>
<li>5. Major Vertex Corps.</li>
<li>6. Major Corps Aligned.</li>
<li>7. Corps Enpotence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></li>
<li>8. Minor Corps Enceinte.</li>
<li>9. Major Corps Enceinte.</li>

<li>11. Corps En Appui.</li>
<li>12. Base Corps Refused.</li>
<li>13. Pivotal Corps Refused.</li>
<li>14. Minor Vertex Corps Refused.</li>
<li>15. Minor Corps Aligned Refused.</li>
<li>16. Major Vertex Corps Refused.</li>
<li>17. Major Corps Aligned Refused.</li>
<li>18. Major Corps Refused Enpotence.</li>
<li>19. Corps en Major Crochet.</li>
<li>20. Corps en Minor Crochet.</li>
<li>21. Corps en Crochet Aligned.</li>
<li>22. Corps Doubly Aligned.</li>
<li>23. Grand Vertex Corps.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above formations by Corps of Position are described
and illustrated in detail in preceding text-books
by the author, entitled:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Minor Tactics of Chess.</li>
<li>The Grand Tactics of Chess.</li>
</ul>

<p>The normal use of Corps of Position is limited to
Lines of Mobilization, of Development and to the Simple
Line of Manoeuvre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<h4>CORPS D’ARMEE OF EVOLUTION.</h4>

<div class="quote">

<p><i>“Every man in Alexander’s army is so well trained and
obedient that at a single word of command, officers and
soldiers make any movement and execute any evolution in
the art of warfare.</i></p>

<p><i>“Only such troops as themselves can check their career
and oppose their bravery and expertness.”&mdash;Caridemus.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>The eight Pieces</i>, by reason of their ability to move in
all directions, the scope of their movements and the
peculiar exercises of their offensive and defensive powers,
are best adapted of the Chesspieces to perform those
functions which in the Military Art appertain to Corps
of Evolution.</p>

<p><i>Corps of Evolution</i> acting offensively, take their individual

<p>The normal use of Corps of Evolution is limited to
Lines of Manoeuvre. When acting on a Simple Line of
Manoeuvre, a Corps of Evolution may deploy on the
corresponding Line of Mobilization; but it has nothing

appertains exclusively to Corps of Position.</p>

<p>Any corps d’armee, whether of Position or of Evolution
may be utilized upon a Line of Operations.</p>

<h4>THE KING.</h4>

<p>Regarded as a Chessic Corps d’armee, the King
marches as infantry, cavalry and artillery; but it attacks
as infantry exclusively and never as cavalry or artillery.</p>

<p>Although every situation upon the Chessboard contemplates
the presence of both Kings, either, or neither,
or both, may, or may not be present in any given Strategetic
Horizon.</p>

<p>Whenever the King is present in a given Strategetic
Horizon the effect of his co-operation is mathematically
outlined, thus:</p>

<ul>
<li>I. At his maximum of efficiency, the King occupies
the centre of a circle of one point radius. His offensive
power is equally valid against all eight points contained
in his circumference, but his defensive power is valid for
the support from a minimum of one point to a maximum
of five points.</li>
<li>II. At his medium of efficiency the King occupies the
centre of a semi-circle of one point radius.
His offensive power is valid against all five points contained
in his semi-circumference, and his defensive
power is valid for the support from a minimum of one, to
a maximum of five points.</li>
<li>III. At his minimum of efficiency, the King occupies
the centre of a quadrant of one point radius. Both his
offensive and his defensive powers are valid against all
three points contained in his segment.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE QUEEN.</h4>

<p>Regarded as a Chessic Corps d’armee the Queen
marches and attacks as infantry, cavalry and artillery.</p>

<p>Either, neither, or both Queens may be present in any
given Strategetic Horizon; and whenever present the
effect of her co-operation mathematically is outlined,
viz.:</p>

<p>At her maximum of efficiency the Queen occupies the
common vertex of one or more unequal triangles, whose
aggregate area is from a minimum of 21 to a maximum
of 27 points. Her offensive power is equally valid
against all of these points; but her defensive power is
valid for the support from a minimum of one point to a
maximum of five points.</p>

<h4>THE ROOK.</h4>

<p>Regarded as a Chessic Corps d’armee the Rook marches
and attacks as infantry, cavalry and artillery.</p>

<p>From one to four Rooks may be present in any given
Strategetic Horizon; and whenever present the effect of
its co-operation mathematically is outlined, viz.:</p>

<p>At her maximum of efficiency, the Rook occupies the
common angle of four quadrilaterals, whose aggregate
area always is 14 points. The Offensive Power of the
Rook is equally valid against all these points, but his defensive
power is valid for the support of only two points.</p>

<h4>THE BISHOP.</h4>

<p>Regarded as a Chessic Corps d’armee, the Bishop
marches and attacks as infantry, cavalry and artillery.</p>

<p>From one to four Bishops may be present in any
Strategetic Horizon; and whenever present the effect of
its co-operation mathematically is outlined, viz.:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>At its maximum of efficiency, the Bishop occupies the
common vertex of four unequal triangles, having a
maximum of 13 and a minimum of 9 points. His
offensive power is valid against all of these points but his
defensive power is valid only for the support of two
points.</p>

<h4>KNIGHT.</h4>

<p>Regarded as a Chessic Corps d’armee the Knight
marches and attacks as cavalry and artillery.</p>

<p>From one to four Knights may be present in any given
Strategetic Horizon; and whenever present the effect of
its co-operation mathematically is outlined, viz.:</p>

<p>At its maximum of efficiency, the Knight occupies the
centre of an octagon of two points radius, having a
minimum of two points and a maximum of eight points
area. His offensive power is equally valid against all
of these eight points, but his defensive power is valid for
the support of only one point.</p>

<h4>THE PAWN.</h4>

<p>Regarded as a Chessic Corps d’armee, the Pawn at its
normal post marches as infantry and cavalry. Should
an adverse corps, however, take post within the kindred
side of the Chessboard; that Pawn upon whose altitude
the adverse Piece appears, at once loses its equestrian
attributes and marches and attacks exclusively as infantry.</p>

<p>Located at any other point than at its normal post, the
Pawn is composed exclusively of infantry and never acts
either as cavalry or artillery.</p>

<p>From one to eight Pawns may be present in any Strategetic
Horizon; and whenever present the effect of its
co-operation mathematically is outlined as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>At its maximum of efficiency the Pawn occupies the
vertex of a triangle of two points. Its offensive power is
equally valid against both of these points; but its defensive
power is valid for the support of only one point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The relative advantage in Organization possessed by
one army over an opposing army always can be determined
by the following, viz.:</p>

<h3><i>RULE.</i></h3>

<p>1. Above a line, set down in order those abbreviations
which properly designate the White corps d’armee present
in a given Strategetic Situation; and below the line, set
down those abbreviations which in like manner designate
the Black corps d’armee, viz.:</p>

<table summary="Relative strengths of Black and White corps">
  <tr>
    <td>K+Q+R+R+P+P+P+P</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="bt">K+Q+R+B+P+P+P+P+P</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>2. Cancel all like symbols and resolve the unlike
symbols remaining, into their respective Potential complements,
viz.:</p>

<table summary="Relative strengths of Black and White corps, simplified to Potential">
  <tr>
    <td>R</td>
    <td rowspan="2">=</td>
    <td></td>

    <td>14</td>
  </tr>

    <td class="bt">10¼</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Subtract the lesser Potential total from the greater
and the difference will be the relative advantage in
Organization.</p>

<p>4. To utilize the relative advantage in Organization
select a battlefield in which the Strategic Key, the
Tactical Keys and the Points of Command of the True
Strategetic Horizon are situated upon the perimeters
of those geometric and sub-geometric symbols which
appertain to the corps d’armee whose superior potentiality
is established by Section 2.</p>

<p>5. To neutralize the relative disadvantage in Organization,
occupy the necessary posts upon the battlefield
selected in such a manner that the kindred decisive
points are situated <i>not</i> upon the perimeters of the
geometric and sub-geometric symbols appertaining to
the adverse corps d’armee of superior potentiality;
while the adverse decisive points <i>are</i> situated upon the
perimeters of the geometric and sub-geometric symbols
which appertain to the kindred corps d’armee of inferior
potentiality.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p><i>“Men habituated to luxury cannot contend with an army
accustomed to fatigue and inured to want.”&mdash;Caesar.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p><i>“That wing with which you propose to engage the enemy
should be composed of your best troops.”&mdash;Epaminondas.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Sacred Band</i> of the Thebans was composed of men
selected for valor and character. Epaminondas called
them <i>Comrades</i> and by honorable rewards and distinctions
induced them to bear without murmur the hardest
fatigues and to confront with intrepidity the greatest
dangers.</p>

<p>At Leuctra (371 B.C.) and again at Mantinea (362
B.C.) the right wing of the Lacedaemonian Army, composed
exclusively of Spartans and for six hundred years
invincible, was overthrown and destroyed by the Sacred
Band led by Epaminondas.</p>

<p>This formidable body of Theban warriors was massacred
by Alexander the Great at the Battle of Chaeronea
(338 B.C.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Macedonian Phalanx</i> was devised by Philip,
King of Macedon. It was made up of heavy infantry
accoutred with cuirass, helmet, greaves, and shield.
The principal weapon was a pike twenty-four feet long.</p>

<p>The Phalanx had a front of two hundred and fifty-six
files and a depth of sixteen ranks. A file of sixteen men
was termed Lochos; two files were called Dilochie; four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
files made a Tetrarchie; eight files a Taxiarchie and
thirty-two of the last constituted a simple Phalanx of
4096 men. A grand Phalanx had a front of one thousand
and twenty-four files and a depth of sixteen ranks.
It was made up of four simple Phalanxes and contained
16,384 men.</p>

<p>With this formation of his infantry, Alexander the
Great, when eighteen years of age, destroyed the Allied
Athenian&mdash;Theban&mdash;Boeotian army at Chaeronea, the
hosts of Persia at the river Grancius (334 B.C.) at
Issus (333 B.C.) and Arbela (331 B.C.) and conquered
Porus, King of India at the Hydaspes (326 B.C.).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Spanish Heavy Cavalry</i> and <i>Nubian Infantry</i> of
Hannibal was a reproduction of that Macedonian organization
whereby Alexander the Great had conquered the
world.</p>

<p>With this formation Hannibal maintained himself for
fifteen years in the richest provinces of Italy and destroyed
seven Roman armies, at the Trebia (218 B.C.) at
Lake Trasymenus (217 B.C.) at Cannae (216 B.C.) and
at Herdonea (212 B.C.) at Herdonea (210 B.C.) at
Locri (208 B.C.) and at Apulia (208 B.C.).</p>

<p>At Zama (202 B.C.) Hannibal’s effacement as a military
factor was directly due to his lack of that organization
which had been the instrument of his previous successes;
a circumstance thus commented on by the victorious
Roman commander, Scipio Africanus;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hitherto I have been opposed by an army without a
general; now they send against me a General without an
army.”</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Tenth Legion</i> of Caesar was the quintessence of
that perfection in elementary tactics devised by the
Romans to accord with the use of artillery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The fundamentals of minor tactics as elucidated by
Epaminondas and exploited by Alexander the Great and
Hannibal are unchanged in the Legion, but by subdivision
of the simple Phalanx into ten Cohorts, a necessary
and maximum gain in mobility was effected.</p>

<p>The Roman Legion consisted of 6100 infantry and 726
cavalry, divided into the Militarain Cohort of 1105
heavy foot, 132 Cuirassiers and nine ordinary Cohorts,
each containing 555 heavy foot and 66 Cuirassiers. The
Legion was drawn up in three lines; the first of which
was termed Principes, the second Hastati, and the third
Triarii. The infantry were protected by helmet, cuirass,
greaves and shield; their arms were a long sword, a short
sword, five javelins and two large spears.</p>

<p>With this formation Caesar over-run Spain, Gaul,
Germany, Britain, Africa, Greece, and Italy. The
Scots alone withstood him and the ruins of a triple line
of Roman entrenchments extending from the North to
the Irish Seas to this day mark the southern boundary
of the Scottish Highlands and the northern limit of Roman
dominion.</p>

<p>At Pharseleus, Pompey made the inexplicable blunder
of placing his best troops in his right wing, which was
covered by the river Enipeus and inferior troops on his
left wing which was in the air. By its first charge, the
Tenth Legion destroyed the latter, outflanked the entire
Pompeian army, drove it backward into the river and
single handed won for Caesar undisputed dominion of the
Earth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Scots Volunteers</i> of Gustavus Adolphus consisted
of two brigades aggregating about 12,000 foot, made up
of Scottish gentlemen who for various reasons were
attracted to the Continental Wars.</p>

<p>At Leipsic, (Sept. 7, 1631) 20,000 Saxons, constituting
one-half of the allied Protestant army, were routed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the first charge, put to flight and never seen again.
Tilly’s victorious right wing then turned upon the flank
of the King’s army. Three regiments of the Scots Volunteers
on foot held in check in open field 12,000 of the
best infantry and cavalry in Europe, until Gustavus had
destroyed the Austrian main body and hastened to their
aid with the Swedish heavy cavalry.</p>

<p>The Castle of Oppenheim was garrisoned by 800 Spanish
infantry. Gustavus drew up 2,000 Swedes to escalade
the place. Thirty Scots Volunteers, looking on
observed that the Spaniards, intently watching the King
had neglected to guard the opposite side of the fortress.
Beckoning to their aid about a hundred of their comrades,
they scaled the wall, captured the garrison and opened
the gates to the king. Gustavus entered on foot, hat
in hand. “My brave Scots,” said he, “you carry in
your scabbards, the key to every castle in Europe.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Van-Guard</i> of Frederic the Great is the perfect
adaptation of the minor tactics of Epaminondas to
gunpowder. This choice body was made up of the best
troops in the army divided into infantry, cuirassiers,
dragoons and light artillery.</p>

<p>The Van-Guard, a miniature army in itself, always
marched between the main body and the enemy; it
always led in the attack, followed by that wing containing
the best soldiers, in two lines; and supported by
the heavy cavalry on that flank.</p>

<p>At Rosbach (Nov. 5, 1757) the Prussian Van-Guard,
composed of 4,800 infantry, 2,500 cavalry and 30 guns,
annihilated 70,000 French regular troops, by evolutions
so rapidly executed that the Prussian main army was
unable to overtake either pursuers or pursued and had
no part in the battle, other than as highly interested
spectators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Continentals</i> of the Revolutionary army under
Washington were made up of troops enlisted for the
war and trained by Baron von Steuben, a Major-General
in the Prussian service, who had served throughout the
Seven Years War under Frederic the Great.</p>

<p>The Continentals, without firing a shot, carried by
assault, Stony Point (July 16, 1779), Paulus Hook (July
20, 1779) and the British intrenchments at Yorktown
(Oct. 19, 1781). Of these troops, the Baron von Steuben
writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am satisfied with having shown to those who understand
the Art of Warfare, an American army worthy of
their approbation; officers who know their profession and
who would do honor to any army in Europe; an infantry
such as England has never brought into the field, soldiers
temperate, well-drilled and obedient and the equal of any
in the world.”</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Consular Guard</i> was the reproduction of the Van
Guard of Frederic the Great, but its sphere of action was
strangely restricted by Bonaparte, who, instead of placing
his best troops in the front of his army, as is the
practice of all other of the Great Captains; subordinated
their functions to that of a reserve and to personal attendance
upon himself.</p>

<p>This Corps d’elite was but once notably in action; at
Marengo (June 14, 1800) it undoubtedly saved the day
for France, by maintaining the battle until the arrival of
Gen. Desaix and his division.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Imperial Guard</i> of Napoleon was the development
of the Consular Guard of Bonaparte. Under the Empire
the Guard became an independent army, consisting
of light and heavy infantry, horse and field artillery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
cuirassiers, dragoons, hussars and chasseurs, and composed
of the best troops in the French service.</p>

<p>The functions of this fine body, like that of its prototype,
was limited to the duties of a reserve and to
attendance upon the person of the Emperor; and perhaps
next to announcement of victory, Napoleon’s
favorite bulletin always read, “The Imperial Guard was
not engaged.”</p>

<p>Many were the unavailing remonstrances made by his
advisors against this policy, which judged by the practice
of the great masters of warfare, is putting the cart before
the horse; and seemingly is that speck of cloud in Napoleon’s
political sky, which properly may be deemed a
precursor of St. Helena.</p>

<p>At Austerlitz (Dec. 2, 1805), the cuirassiers of the
French Imperial Guard routed a like body of Russian
cavalry. At Eylau (Nov. 7, 1807) the Guard, as
at Marengo again saved the day, after the corps d’armee
of Soult and Angereau had been destroyed, by maintaining
the battle until the arrival of Ney and Davoust. In
the retreat from Russia (1812) the Guard then numbering
64,000 men was nearly destroyed. What was left
of it won at Ligny (June 16, 1815), Napoleon’s last
victory and at Waterloo (June 18, 1815), one of its two
surviving divisions covered the flight of the French
army, while the other escorted Napoleon in safety to
Paris.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Royal Prussian Guard</i>, under Von Moltke, was
organized and utilized in accord with the teachings of
Frederic the Great.</p>

<p>Its most notable achievement occurred in the campaign
of 1870. The right flank of the French having
been turned by the battle of Woerth (Aug. 4, 1870) and
Marshal MacMahon’s army being driven to the westward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
it became the paramount object of Von Moltke to
seize the country in rear of Metz and thus prevent the retreat
of Marshall Bazine across the Moselle River.</p>

<p>The Royal Prussian Guard out-marching both friends
and enemies first reached the Nancy road (Aug. 18, 1870)
and until the German corps reached the battlefield this
body of picked troops successfully withstood the assault
of nearly the entire French army. In the first half-hour
the Guard lost 8,000 men.</p>

<p>As the result of all this, Marshal Bazine with 150,000
men was forced back into and taken in the intrenched
camp at Metz; and the Emperor Napoleon III, Marshal
MacMahon and a second French army of 140,000 men
was captured at Sedan (Sept. 1, 1870), in an attempt to
rescue Marshal Bazine.</p>

<p><i>“I must tell you beforehand this will be a bloody touch.
Tilly has a great army of old lads with iron faces that dare
look an enemy in the eye; they are confident of victory, have
never been beaten and do not know what it means to fly.
Tilly tells his men he will beat me and the old man is as
likely to do it as to say it.”&mdash;Gustavus Adolphus.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p>“Tilly’s men were rugged, surly fellows; their faces
mangled by wounds and scars had an air of hardy courage.
I observed of them that their clothes were always dirty,
their armor rusty from winter storms and bruised by
musket-balls, their weapons sharp and bright. They
were used to camp in the open fields and to sleep in the
frosts and rain. The horses like the men were strong and
hardy and knew by rote their exercises. Both men and
animals so well understood the trade of arms that a
general command was sufficient; every man was fit to
command the whole, and all evolutions were performed in
order and with readiness, at a note of the trumpet or a
motion of their banners.</p>

<p>“The 7th of Sept. (1631) before sunrise, the Swedish
army marched from Dieben to a large field about a mile
from Leipsic, where we found old Tilly’s army in full
battalia in admirable order, which made a show both
glorious and terrible.</p>

<p>“Tilly, like a fair gamester, had taken up but one side
of the plain, and left the other side clear and all the
avenues open to the King’s approach, nor did he stir
to the charge until the Swedish army was fully drawn up
and was advancing toward him. He had with him 44,000
old soldiers and a better army I believe never was so
soundly beaten.…</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then was made a
most dreadful slaughter, and yet there was no flying.
Tilly’s men might be killed or knocked down, but no man
turned his back, nor would give an inch of ground,
save as they were marched, wheeled, or retreated by
their officers.… About six
o’clock the field was cleared of the enemy except at one
place on the King’s front, where some of them rallied;
and though they knew that all was lost, they would take
no quarter, but fought it out to the last man, being found
dead the next day in rank and file as they were drawn
up.”</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>This is effected by so posting the kindred corps that in the
resulting Strategetic Horizons, impassable natural barriers
are presented to the march of hostile corps toward their
respective objectives.</i></p>

<p>On the surface of the earth such natural barriers are
formed by mountains, rivers, lakes, swamps, forests,
deserts, the ocean, and the boundaries of neutral States.</p>

<p>On the Chess-board these topographical conditions are
typified by peculiarities and limitations in the movements
of the Chess-pieces, viz.:</p>

<ul>
<li>I. The sides of the Chess-board which terminate all
movements of the chess pieces.</li>
<li>II. That limitation of the movements of the Chesspieces
which makes it impossible for them to move other
than in straight lines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></li>
<li>III. The inability of the Queen to move on obliques.</li>
<li>IV. The inability of the Rook to move either on
obliques or on diagonals.</li>
<li>V. The inability of the Bishop to move either on
obliques, verticals, or horizontals.</li>
<li>VI. The inability of the Knight to move either on
diagonals, verticals, or horizontals, and the limitation of
its move to two squares distance.</li>
<li>VII. The inability of the Pawn to move either on
obliques or horizontals, and the limitation of its first move
to two squares and of its subsequent moves to one square.</li>
<li>VIII. The limitation of the King’s move to one
square.</li>
</ul>

<p>These limitations and impediments to the movements
of the Chess-pieces, are equivalent in Chess-play to obstacles
interposed by Nature to the march of troops
over the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>Prefect Generalship, in its calculations, so combines
these insurmountable barriers with the relative positions
of the contending armies, that the kindred army becomes
at every vital point the superior force.</p>

<p>This effect is produced by merely causing rivers and
mountains to take the place of kindred Corps d’armee.</p>

<p>It is only by the study of Chessic topography that the
tremendous problems solved by the chess player become
manifest:</p>

<p><i>Instead of calculations limited to one visible and unchangeable
Chess-board of sixty-four squares, the divinations
of the Chess-master comprehend and harmonize as
many invisible Chess-boards as there are Chess-pieces contained
in the Topographical Zone.</i></p>

<p>Furthermore, all these surfaces differ to the extent and
in conformity to that particular sensible horizon, appertaining
to the Chess-piece from which it emanates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>The enormous difficulties of Chess-play, like those of
warfare, arise from the necessity of combining in a single
composite topographical horizon, all those differing,
sensible horizons which appertain, not merely to the
kindred, but also to the hostile corps; and to do this in
such a manner, as to minimize the hostile powers for
offence and defence, by debarring one or more of the
hostile pieces from the true Strategetic Horizon.</p>

<p><i>To divide up the enemy’s force, by making natural
barriers take the place of troops, is the basis of those processes
which dominate Grand Manoeuvres.</i></p>

<p>Of all the deductions of Chess-play and of warfare,
such combinations of Strategy and Topography are the
most subtle and intangible. The highest talent is
required in its interpretation, and mastery of it, more
than of any other branch of Strategetics, proclaims the
great Captain at war, or at chess.</p>

<h3>TOPOGRAPHY OF THE KING</h3>

<p>From the view-point of the <i>King</i>, the surface of the
Chess-board takes on the topographical aspect of a vast
expanse of open, level country.</p>

<p>This vista is void of insurmountable natural obstacles,
other than the sides and extremities. The latter collectively
may be regarded, for strategical purposes,
either as the Ocean, or the boundaries of neutral States.</p>

<p>To the King, this vast territory is accessible in all
directions. At his pleasure he may move to and occupy
either of the sixty-four squares of the Chess-board, in a
minimum of one and in a maximum of seven moves.
The only obstacles to his march are distance and the
opposition of an enemy.</p>

<p>The Strategical weakness of the Topographical Horizon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
peculiar to the King arises from its always taking on and
maintaining the physical form of a plain. Consequently
it is vulnerable to attack from all sides and what is far
worse, it readily is commanded and from a superior
topographical post, by every adverse piece, except the
King and Pawn.</p>

<p>Thus, the hostile Queen, without being attacked in return,
may enfilade the King along all verticals, horizontals
and diagonals; the Rooks, along all verticals and
horizontals; the Bishops, along all diagonals of like color;
and the Knights along all obliques.</p>

<h3>TOPOGRAPHY OF THE QUEEN</h3>

<p>From the view-point of the <i>Queen</i>, the surface of the
Chess-board takes on the topographical aspect of a series
of wide, straight valleys separated by high, impassable
mountain ranges, unfordable rivers, and impenetrable
forests and morasses. These valleys, which number never
less than three, nor more than eight, in the same group,
are of varying length and always converge upon and
unite with each other at the point occupied by the Queen.</p>

<p>These valleys contained in the Queen’s topographical
horizon may be classified, viz.:</p>

<p>Class I, consists of those groups made up of three
valleys.</p>

<p>Class II, of those groups made up of five valleys.</p>

<p>Class III, of those groups made up of eight valleys of
lesser area; and</p>

<p>Class IV, of those groups made up of eight valleys of
greater area.</p>

<p>Groups of the first class always have an area of twenty
points; those of the second have an area of twenty-three
points; those of the third have an area of twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
points, and those of the fourth have an area of twenty-seven
points. Such areas always are exclusive of that
point upon which the Queen is posted.</p>

<p>Although impassable natural barriers restrict the
movement of the Queen to less than one-half of the
Topographical Zone, these obstacles always are intersected
by long stretches of open country formed by
intervening valleys.</p>

<p>Hence, the march of this most mobile of the Chesspieces
always is open either in three, five, or eight directions,
and it always is possible for her, unless impeded by
the interference of kindred or hostile corps, to reach any
desired point on the Chess-board in two moves.</p>

<p>The weakness peculiar to the Topographical Horizon
which appertains to the Queen, originates in the fact that
it never commands the origins of obliques. Consequently,
every post of the Queen, is open to unopposed
attack by the hostile Knights.</p>

<h3>TOPOGRAPHY OF THE ROOK</h3>

<p>From the view-point of the <i>Rook</i>, the surface of the
Chess-board takes on a topographical aspect which varies
with the post occupied.</p>

<p>Placed at either R1 or R8 the Rook occupies the central
point of a great valley, 15 points in length, which winds
around the slope of an immense and inaccessible mountain
range. This latter, in extent, includes the remainder
of the Topographical Zone.</p>

<p>With the Rook placed at R2 or R7, this great mountain
wall becomes pierced by a long valley running at right
angles to the first, but the area open to the movement
of the Rook is not increased.</p>

<p>Placed at Kt2, B3, K4, or Q4, the Rook becomes enclosed
amid impassable natural barriers. But although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
in such cases it always occupies the point of union of four
easily traversed although unequal valleys, its area of
movement is neither increased nor diminished, remaining
always at fourteen points open to occupation.</p>

<p>Unless impeded by the presence of kindred or adverse
corps on its logistic radii, the Rook always may move
either in two, three, or four directions, and it may reach
any desired point on the Chess-board in two moves.</p>

<p>The weakness peculiar to the Topographical Horizon
of the Rook lies in the fact that it never commands the
origins of diagonals or obliques. Hence it is open to
unopposed attack along the first from adverse Queen,
King, Bishops and Pawns, and along the second from
adverse Knights.</p>

<h3>TOPOGRAPHY OF THE BISHOP</h3>

<p>From the view-point of the <i>Bishop</i>, the surface of the
Chess-board takes on a topographical aspect most forbidding.</p>

<p>To this Chess-piece at least one-half of the Topographical
Zone is inaccessible, and under any circumstances
his movements are limited to the thirty-two
squares of his own color.</p>

<p>Thus, the Topographical Horizon of the Bishop takes
the form of a broken country, dotted with high hills,
deep lakes, impenetrable swamps, and thick woodlands.
But between these obstacles thus set about by Nature,
run level valleys, varied in extent and easy of access.
This fact so modifies this harshest of all sensible horizons
as to make the Bishop next in activity to the Rook.</p>

<p>Within its limited sphere of action, the Bishop may
move in either one or four directions with a minimum of
nine and a maximum of fourteen points open to his
occupation. Unimpeded by other corps blocking his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
route of march, the Bishop may reach any desired point
of his own color on the chess board in two moves.</p>

<p>The weakness peculiar to the topographical horizon
of the Bishop is its liability to unopposed attack along
verticals and horizontals by the hostile King, Queen and
Rooks; and along obliques by the hostile Knights.</p>

<h3>TOPOGRAPHY OF THE KNIGHT</h3>

<p>From the view-point of the <i>Knight</i>, the surface of the
Chess-board takes on the aspect of a densely wooded
and entirely undeveloped country; made up of a profusion
of ponds, rivulets, swamps, etc., none of which are
impassable although sufficient to impede progress.</p>

<p>Unless interfered with by kindred or hostile corps, or
the limitations of the Chess-board, the Knight always
may move either in two, four, six, or eight directions.
It may reach any desired point in a minimum of one and
a maximum of six moves, and may occupy the sixty-four
squares of the Chess-board in the same number of
marches.</p>

<p>The weakness of the topographical horizon of the
Knight lies in the fact that it never commands adjacent
points, nor any of those distant, other than the
termini of its own obliques. Hence it is open to unopposed
attack along verticals and horizontals from the
adverse King, Queen and Rooks, and along diagonals
from the adverse King, Queen, Bishop and Pawns.</p>

<h3>TOPOGRAPHY OF THE PAWN</h3>

<p>From the point of view of the <i>Pawn</i>, the surface of the
Chess-board takes on the topographical aspect of a
country which as it is entered, constantly becomes wilder
and more rugged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The march of the Pawn always is along a valley situated
between impracticable natural barriers, and the
possible movements of the Pawn always decrease as the
distance traveled increases.</p>

<p>Unhindered by either kindred or hostile corps, the
Pawn may reach any point of junction in the kindred
Logistic Horizon, which is contained within its altitude,
in a minimum of five and in a maximum of six moves.
It may march only in one direction, except in capturing,
when it may acquire the option of acting in three directions.</p>

<p>The weakness of the topographical horizon of the
Pawn originates in its inability to command the adjacent
country. Therefore, it is exposed to unopposed attack
along verticals and horizontals by the hostile King,
Queen and Rooks; along diagonals by the adverse King,
Queen and Bishops, and along obliques by the adverse
Knights.</p>

<h3>TOPOGRAPHY OF THE TOPOGRAPHICAL ZONE</h3>

<p>That normal and visible surface of the <i>Chess-board</i>
termed the Topographical Zone is bounded by four great
natural barriers, impassable to any Chess-piece.</p>

<p>The two sides of the zone may be held to typify either
the Ocean or the boundaries of neutral States. The two
extremities of the Chess-board while holding the previously
announced relation to Chess-pieces contained in
the Topographical Zone, also holds another and radically
different relation to those Chess-pieces <i>not</i> contained in
the Topographical Zone, viz.:</p>

<p>In the latter case, the two extremities of the chessboard
are to be regarded as two great mountain ranges,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
each of which is pierced by eight defiles, the latter being
the sixteen points of junction contained in the kindred
and adverse logistic horizons.</p>

<p>In the arena thus formed by these four great natural
barriers, two hostile armies composed of the thirty-two
Chess-pieces, are contending for the mastery.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, beyond these great mountain ranges, are
advancing to the aid of the combatants, two other armies,
represented by the power of promotion possessed by the
Pawns. Each of these two hypothetical armies is assailing
the outer slope of that range of mountains which lies
in the rear of the hostile force. Its effort is to pass one
of the eight defiles and by occupying a Point of Junction
in the kindred Logistic Horizon, to gain entrance into
the Topographical Zone. Then in the array of a Queen,
or some other kindred piece, it purposes to attack decisively,
the adverse Strategetic Rear.</p>

<p>To oppose the attack of this hypothetical hostile army,
whose movements always are typified by the advance of
the adverse Pawns, is the duty of the kindred column of
manoeuvre.</p>

<p>Primarily this labor falls upon the kindred Pawns.
Upon each Pawn devolves the duty of guarding that
defile situated directly on its front, by maintaining itself
as a Point of Impenetrability between the corresponding
hostile pawn and the kindred Strategic Rear.</p>

<p>Conversely, a second duty devolves upon each Pawn;
and as an integer of the Column of Support, it continually
must threaten and whenever opportunity is
presented it decisively must assault the defile on its
front, for the purpose of penetrating to the kindred
logistic horizon and becoming promoted to such kindred
piece, as by attacking the adverse Determinate Force
in flank, in rear, or in both, may decide the victory in
favor of the kindred army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Every variety of topography has peculiar requirements
for its attack and its defence; and situations even though
but little different from each other, nevertheless must be
treated according to their particular nature.</p>

<p>In order to acquire the habit of selecting at a glance
the correct posts for an army and of making proper
dispositions of the kindred corps with rapidity and precision,
topography should be studied with great attention,
for most frequently it happens that circumstances do
not allow time to do these things with deliberation.</p>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>Acting either offensively or defensively, one never should
proceed in such a way as to allow the enemy the advantage
of ground;</i></p>

<p>That is to say: Kindred corps never should be exposed
to unopposed adverse radii of offence, when the effect
of such exposure is the loss of kindred material, or of
time much better to be employed, than in making a necessary
and servile retreat from an untenable post.</p>

<p>On the contrary, every kindred topographical advantage
should unhesitatingly be availed of; and particular
attention continually should be paid to advancing
the kindred corps to points offensive where they cannot
be successfully attacked.</p>

<p>Pains always must be taken to select advantageous
ground. Indifferent posts must never be occupied from
sheer indolence or from over-confidence in the strength
of the kindred, or the weakness of the adverse army.</p>

<p>Particularly must one beware of permitting the enemy
to retain advantages in topography; always and at once
he should be dislodged from posts whose continued occupation
may facilitate his giving an unforeseen and often
a fatal blow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The full importance of topography perhaps is best expressed
in the following dictum by the great Frederic:</p>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging">“<i>Whenever a general and decisive topographical advantage
is presented, one has merely to avail of this, without troubling
about anything further.</i>”</p>

<p>The relative advantage in Topography possessed by
one army over an opposing army, always can be determined
by the following, viz.:</p>

<h3>RULE</h3>

<p>1. If the principal adverse Corps of Position are
situated upon points of a given color, and if the principal
Kindred Corps of Position are situated upon points <i>not</i>
of the given color, then:</p>

<p>That army which has the <i>more</i> Corps of Evolution able
to act against points of the given color, and the <i>equality</i>
in Corps of Evolution able to act against points of the
opposite color, has the relative advantage in Topography.</p>

<p>2. To utilize the relative advantage in Topography,
construct a position in which the kindred Corps of Position
necessary to be defended shall occupy a point upon
the sub-geometric symbol of a kindred Corps of Evolution;
which point shall be a Tactical Key of a True
Strategetic Horizon of which the kindred Corps of Evolution
is the Corps of the Centre and of which either the
adverse King or an undefendable adverse piece is the
second Tactical Key.</p>

<p>3. To neutralize the relative disadvantage in Topography,
eliminate that adverse Corps d’armee which is able
to act simultaneously by its geometric symbol against
the principal Kindred Corps of Position upon a given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
color; and by its sub-geometric symbol against points of
opposite color.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Perfection in Defensive Topography is attained whenever
the ground occupied nullifies hostile advantages in
Time, Organization, Mobility, Numbers and Position.</p>

<p>Perfection in Offensive Topography is attained whenever
the ground occupied accentuates the kindred advantages
in Time, Organization, Mobility, Numbers and
Position.</p>

<p><i>“When you intend to engage in battle endeavor that your
CHIEF advantage shall arise from the ground occupied

</div>

<p>To cross the Granicus, Alexander the Great selected
a fordable spot where the river made a long, narrow
bend, and attacked the salient and both sides simultaneously.
The Persians thus outflanked were easily
and quickly routed; whereupon the Grecian army in
line of Phalanxes, both flanks covered by the river and
its retreat assured by the fords in rear, advanced to
battle in harmony with all requirements of Strategetic
Art.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At Issus, Alexander the Great so manoeuvred that the
Persian army of more than a million men was confined
in a long valley not over three miles in width, having the
sea on the left hand and the Amanus Mountains on the
right, thus the Grecians had a battlefield fitted to the
size of their army, and fought in Phalanxes in line, both
wings covered by impassable natural barriers and retreat
assured, by open ground in rear.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the Trebia, Hannibal by stratagems now undiscernible,
induced the consul Sempronius to pass the
river and following along the easterly bank to take position
with his army upon the lowlands between an unfordable
part of the stream and the Carthagenians.</p>

<p>Upon this, Hannibal detached his youngest brother
Margo to cut off the retreat of the Romans from the
ford by which they had crossed the Trebia; advanced his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
infantry by Phalanxes in line and overthrowing the few
Roman horse, assailed the hostile left wing with 10,000
heavy cavalry. The destruction of the Roman army was
completed by the simultaneous attack of their right
wing by Margo and the impossibility of repassing the
river in their rear.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By one of the most notable marches in surprise recorded
in military annals, Hannibal crossed the seemingly
impassible marshes of the river Po, and turned
the left flank of the Roman army, commanded by the
Consul C. Flaminius. Then the great Carthagenian
advanced swiftly toward the city of Rome, devasting the
country on either hand.</p>

<p>In headlong pursuit the Consul entered a long narrow
valley, having Lake Trasymenus on the one hand and
the mountains on the other.</p>

<p>Suddenly while entombed in this vast ravine, the
Roman army was attacked by infantry from the high
ground along its right flank; and in front and rear by the
Carthagenian heavy cavalry, while the lake extending
along its left flank made futile all attempts to escape.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At Cannae, Hannibal reproduced the evolutions of
Alexander the Great at the passage of the Granicus.
Selecting a long bend in the Aufidus, Hannibal forded
the river and took position by Phalanxes in line, his
flanks covered by unfordable parts of the stream and his
retreat assured by the fords by which he had crossed,
while as at Issus, the ground on his front though fitting
his own army, was so confined as to prevent the Romans
engaging a force greater than his own. Beyond Hannibal’s
front, the hostile army was posted in a wide level<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
plain, suited to the best use of the vastly superior Carthagenian
heavy cavalry, both for the evolutions of the
battle and the subsequent pursuit and massacre of the
Romans.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the River Arar (58 B.C.) Caesar achieved his first
victory. Following leisurely but closely the marauding
Helvetii, he permitted three-fourths of their army to
cross to the westerly side of the river; then he fell upon
the remainder with his whole army.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An eye-witness thus describes the famous passage of
the Lech by Gustavus Adolphus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Resolved to view the situation of the enemy, his
majesty went out the 2nd of April (1632) with a strong
body of horse, which I had the honor to command.
We marched as near as we could to the bank of the river,
not to be too much exposed to the enemy’s cannon; and
having gained a height where the whole course of the
river might be seen, we drew up and the king alighted
and examined every reach and turning of the river with
his glass. Toward the north, he found the river fetching
a long reach and doubling short upon itself. ‘There is
the point will do our business,’ says the king, ‘and if
the ground be good, we will pass there, though Tilly
do his worst’.”</p>

</div>

<p>He immediately ordered a small party of horse to
bring him word how high the bank was on each side and
at the point, “and he shall have fifty dollars” says the
king, “who will tell me how deep the water is.”</p>

<p>… The depth and breadths of
the stream having been ascertained, and the bank on our
side being ten to twelve feet higher than the other and of
a hard gravel, the king resolved to cross there; and himself
gave directions for such a bridge as I believe never
army passed before nor since.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>The bridge was loose plank placed upon large tressels
as bricklayers raise a scaffold to build a wall. The
tressels were made some higher and some lower to answer
to the river as it grew deeper or shallower; and all was
framed and fitted before any attempt was made to cross.</p>

<p>At night, April 4th the king posted about 2,000 men
near the point and ordered them to throw up trenches on
either side and quite around it; within which at each end
the king placed a battery of six pieces and six cannon at
the point, two guns in front and two at each side. By
daylight, all the batteries were finished, the trenches
filled with musketeers and all the bridge equipment at
hand in readiness for use. To conceal this work the king
had fired all night at other places along the river.</p>

<p>At daylight, the Imperialists discovered the king’s
design, when it was too late to prevent it. The musketeers
and the batteries made such continual fire that the
other bank twelve feet below was too hot for the Imperialists;
whereupon old Tilly to be ready for the king
on his coming over on his bridge, fell to work and raised
a twenty-gun battery right against the point and a
breast-work as near the river as he could to cover his
men; thinking that when the King should build his
bridge, he might easily beat it down with his cannon.</p>

<p>But the King had doubly prevented him; first by
laying his bridge so low that none of Tilly’s shot could
hurt it, for the bridge lay not above half a foot above the
water’s edge; and the angle of the river secured it against
the batteries on the other side, while the continual fire
beat the Imperialists from those places where they had
no works to cover them.</p>

<p>Now, in the second place, the King sent over four
hundred men who cast up a large ravelin on the other
bank just where he planned to land; and while this was
doing the King laid over his bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Both sides wrought hard all the day and all the night
as if the spade, not the sword, was to decide the controversy;
meanwhile the musketry and cannon-balls flew
like hail and both sides had enough to do to make the
men stand to their work. The carnage was great;
many officers were killed. Both the King and Tilly
animated the troops by their presence.</p>

<p>About one o’clock about the time when the King had
his bridge finished and in heading a charge of 3000 foot
against our ravelin was brave old Tilly slain by a musket
bullet in the thigh.</p>

<p>We knew nothing of this disaster befallen them, and
the King, who looked for blows, the bridge and ravelin
being finished, ordered to run a line of palisades to take
in more ground and to cover the first troops he should
send over. This work being finished the same night, the
King sent over his Guards and six hundred Scots to man
the new line.</p>

<p>Early in the morning a party of Scots under Capt.
Forbes of Lord Rae’s regiment was sent abroad to learn
something of the enemy and Sir John Hepburn with the
Scots Brigade was ordered to pass the bridge, draw up
outside the ravelin, and to advance in search of the
enemy as soon as the horse were come over.</p>

<p>The King was by this time at the head of his army in
full battle array, ready to follow his van-guard and expecting
a hot day’s work of it. Sir John sent messenger
after messenger entreating for permission to advance,
but the King would not suffer it; for he was ever on his
guard and would not risk a surprise. So the army continued
on this side of the Lech all day and the next night.</p>

<p>In the morning the King ordered 300 horse, 600 horse
and 800 dragoons to enter the wood by three ways, but
sustaining each other; the Scots Brigade to follow to the
edge of the wood in support of all, and a brigade of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Swedish infantry to cover Sir John’s troops. So warily
did this famous warrior proceed.</p>

<p>The next day the cavalry came up with us led by

<p class="hanging"><i>“It is easier to beat an enemy than commonly is supposed,”
says Napoleon, “the great Art lies in making nothing
but decisive movements.”</i></p>

<p>To the proficient in Strategetics the truth of the foregoing
dictum is self-evident. Nevertheless, it remains
to instruct the student how to select from a multitude of
possible movements, that particular movement or series
of movements, which in a given situation are best calculated
to achieve victory.</p>

<p>Whatever may be such series of movements, obviously,
it must have an object, <i>i.e.</i>, a specific and clearly defined
purpose. Equally so, all movements made on such line
of movement must each have an objective, <i>i.e.</i>, a terminus.
These objectives, like cogs in a gear, intimately
are connected with other objectives or termini, so that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
project thus formed constitutes always an exact and often
a vast scheme.</p>

<p>Frequently it happens that the occupation of an
objective, valid in a given situation, is not valid in an
ensuing situation for the reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. That the object of the given line of movement is
become unattainable, or,</li>
<li>2. Because it has become no longer worth attaining,
or,</li>
<li>3. Because such belated attainment may be direct
cause of disaster.</li>
</ul>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>In order to select the decisive movement in a given situation
it is necessary first to determine both the object and
the objective, not merely of the required movement, but also
of that series of movements, which collectively constitute the
projected line of movement; together with the object and the
objective of every movement contained therein.</i></p>

<p>The mathematician readily will perceive, and the
student doubtless will permit himself to be informed,
that:</p>

<p>Before the true object and the true objective of any
movement can be determined it first is necessary to
deduce the common object of all movement.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As is well known, the combined movements of the
Chess-pieces over the surface of the Chess-board during
a game at Chess are infinite.</p>

<p>These calculations are so complex that human perception
accurately can forecast ultimate and even immediate
results only in comparatively few and simple
situations. Such calculable outcomes are limited to the
earlier stages of the opening, to the concluding phases of a
game; and to situations in the mid-game wherein the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
presence of but few adverse pieces minimizes the volume
of effort possible to the opponent.</p>

<p>Consequently, it is self-evident, that:</p>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>Situations on the Chess-board require for their demonstration
a degree of skill which decreases as the hostile
power of resistance decreases.</i></p>

<p>All power for resistance possessed by an army emanates
from its ability to move. This faculty of Mobility is
that inestimable quality without which nothing and by
means of which everything, can be done.</p>

<p>From this truth it is easy to deduce the common object
of all movement, which obviously is:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>To minimize the mobility of the opposing force.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The hostile army having the ability to move and consequently
a power for resistance equal to that possessed
by the kindred army; it becomes of the first importance to
discover in what way the kindred army is superior to
that adverse force, which in the Normal Situation on the
Chess-board is its exact counterpart in material, position
and formation.</p>

<p>Such normal superiority of the White army over the
Black army is found in the fact that:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. <i>The former has the privilege of making the
initial move of the game.</i></li>
<li>2. <i>This privilege of first move is the absolute advantage
in Time.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>While no mathematical demonstration of the outcome
of a game at Chess is possible, nevertheless there are
rational grounds for assuming that with exact play, White
should win.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>This decided and probably decisive advantage possessed
by White can be minimized only by correcting a
mathematical blemish in the game of Chess as at present
constructed; which blemish, there is reason to believe,
did not originally exist.</p>

<p>This imperfection seemingly is the result of unscientific
modifications of the Italian method of Castling;
which latter, from the standpoint of mathematics and of
Strategetics, embodies the true spirit of that delicate and
vital evolution.</p>

<p>To the mathematician and to the Strategist, it is clear
that Chess as first devised was geometrically perfect.
The abortions played during successive ages and in
various parts of the Earth, merely are crude and unscientific
deviations from the perfect original.</p>

<p>Thus, strategetically, the correct post of deployment
for the Chess-King is at the extremity of a straight line
drawn from the center of that Grand Strategic Front
which appertains to the existing formation.</p>

<p>Hence, in the grand front by the right, the King in
Castling K R, properly goes in one move to KKt1, his
proper post. Conversely, in Castling Q R, he also should
go in one move to QKt1, his proper post corresponding to
the grand front by the left.</p>

<p>Again, whenever the formation logically points to the
grand front by the right refused, the King should go in
one move from K1 to KR1. When the formations indicate
the grand front by the left refused, the King
should go in one move from K1 to QR1.</p>

<p>In each and every case the co-operating Rook should
be posted at the corresponding Bishop’s square, in order
to support the alignment by P-B4, of the front adopted.</p>

<p>The faulty mode of castling today in vogue clearly
is not the product either of the mathematic nor of the
strategetic mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>The infantile definition of “the books,” viz., “The
King in Castling moves two squares either to the right
or to the left,” displays all that mania for the commonplace,
which characterizes the dilettante.</p>

<p>All that can be done is to call attention to this baleful
excrescence on the great Game. Of course, it is useless
to combat it. In the words of the Count de Saxe:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The power of custom is absolute. To depart from it
is a crime, and the most inexcusable of all crimes is to
introduce innovations. For most people, it is sufficient
that a thing is so, to forever allow it to remain so.”</p>

</div>

<p>Says the great Frederic;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Man hardly may eradicate in his short lifetime all the
prejudices that are imbibed with his mother’s milk; and
it is well nigh impossible to successfully wrestle with
custom, that chief argument of fools.”</p>

</div>

<p>Also bearing in mind the irony of Cicero, who regarded
himself fortunate in that he had not fallen victim to
services rendered his countrymen, it suffices to say:</p>

<p>The true Chessic dictum in regard to the double
evolution of the King and Rook should read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>The King of Castling should deploy in one move to
that point where, as the Base of Operations, it mathematically
harmonizes with that Strategic Front, which is,
or must become, established.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>The change in the present form of Castling, herein
suggested, should be made in the true interests of the
Royal Game.</p>

<p>The instant effect of such change will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Largely to increase the defensive resources both
of White and Black;</li>
<li>2. To minimize the handicap on the second player,
due to White’s advantage of first move;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></li>
<li>3. To permit open play on the Queen’s side of the
board and thus provide a broader and more resplendent
field for Strategetic genius.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In all our modern-day mis-interpretations of the ethics
of Chess and our characteristic Twentieth Century
looseness of practice as applied to Chess-play, perhaps
there exists no greater absurdity, than that subversion
of ordinary intelligence, daily evinced by permitting a
piece which cannot move, to give check.</p>

<p>It is a well known and in many ways a deserved reproach,
cast by the German erudite, that the mind of
the Anglo-Saxon is not properly developed, that it is
able to act correctly only when dealing with known
quantities, and is inadequate for the elucidation of
indeterminate things.</p>

<p>In consequence, they say, the argumentative attempts
of the Anglo-Saxon are puerile; the natural result of a
mental limitation which differs from that of monkeys
and parrots, merely in ability to count beyond two.</p>

<p>Surely it would seem that a very young child readily
would sense that:</p>

<p>A Chess-piece, which by law is debarred from movement,
is, by the same law, necessarily debarred from
capturing adverse material; inasmuch as in order to
capture, a piece must move.</p>

<p>Nevertheless consensus of opinion today among
children of every growth and whether Anglo-Saxon or
German, universally countenance the paradox that:</p>

<p>A piece which is pinned on its own King, can give check
<i>i.e.</i>, threaten to move and capture the adverse King.</p>

<p>To argue this question correctly and to deduce the
logical solution, it is necessary to revert to first principles
and to note that:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a fundamental of Chess mathematics that the
King cannot be exposed to capture.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is to be noted as equally fundamental,
that:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. A piece exerts no force against that point upon
which it is posted;</li>
<li>2. That whatever power a piece exerts, always is
exerted against some other point than the point upon
which it stands; and that;</li>
<li>3. In order to exert such power, it is an all-essential
that the piece move from the point which it occupies to
the point at which its power is to be exerted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hence, it is obvious and may be mathematically demonstrated,
that,</p>

<ul>
<li>1. A piece which cannot move, cannot capture.</li>
<li>2. A piece which cannot capture, does not exercise
any threat of capture; and</li>
<li>3. Consequently, a piece deprived of its right to
move; which cannot capture nor exercise any threat to
capture, obviously and by mathematical demonstration,
cannot give check, inasmuch, as “check” merely is the
threat by a piece to move and capture the adverse King.</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, whatever may be the normal area of movement
belonging to a piece, whenever from any cause
such piece loses its power of movement, then,</p>

<p>It no longer can capture, nor exercise any threat of
capture, upon the points contained within said area; and
consequently such points so far as said immovable piece
is concerned, may be occupied in safety by any adverse
piece including the adverse King, for the reason that:</p>

<p>An immovable piece cannot move; and not being able
to move it cannot capture, and not being able to capture,
it does not exercise any threat of capture, and consequently
it cannot give check.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>This incongruity of permitting an immovable piece to
give check constitutes the second mathematical blemish
in the game of Chess, as at present constructed.</p>

<p>This fallacy, the correction of which any schoolboy
may mathematically demonstrate, is defended, even by
many who would know better, if they merely would take
time for reflection; by the inane assumption, that:</p>

<p>A piece which admittedly is disqualified and rendered
dormant by all the fundamentals of the science of Chess,
and which therefore cannot legally move and consequently
cannot legally capture anything; by some
hocus-pocus may be made to move and to capture that
<i>most</i> valuable of <i>all</i> prizes, the adverse King; and this
at a time and under circumstances when, as is universally
allowed, it cannot legally move against, nor legally capture
<i>any other</i> adverse piece.</p>

<p>The basis of this illogical, illegal, and untenable assumption
is:</p>

<p>The pinned piece, belonging to that force which has
the privilege of moving, can abandon its post, and capture
the adverse King; this stroke ends the game and
the game being ended, the pinning piece never can avail
of the abandonment of the covering post by the pinned
piece to capture the King thus exposed.</p>

<p>The insufficiency of this subterfuge is clear to the
mathematical mind. Its subtlety lies in confounding
together things which have no connection, viz.:</p>

<p>Admittedly the given body of Chess-pieces has the
right to move, but it is of the utmost importance to
note that this privilege of moving extends only to a single
piece and from this privilege of moving the pinned piece
is debarred by a specific and fundamental law of the
game, which declares that:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A piece shall not by removing itself uncover the
kindred King to the attack of a hostile piece.”</p>

</div>

<p>Thus, it is clear, that a pinned piece is a disqualified
piece; its powers are dormant and by the laws of the
game it is temporarily reduced to an inert mass, and
deprived of every faculty normally appertaining to it as a
Chess-piece. On the other hand, as is equally obvious,
the pinning piece is in full possession of its normal powers
and is qualified to perform every function.</p>

<p>To hold that a piece disqualified by the laws of the
game can nullify the activities of a piece in full possession
of its powers, is to assert that black is white, that the
moon is made of green cheese, that the tail can wag the
dog, or any other of those things which have led the German
to promulgate his caustic formula on the Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>Hence, artificially to nullify the normal powers of an
active and potential piece which is operating in conformity
to the laws of the game, and artificially to revivify
the dormant powers of a piece disqualified by the
same laws; to debar the former from exercising its
legitimate functions and to permit the latter to exercise
functions from which by law, it specifically is debarred,
is a self-evident incongruity and any argument whereby
such procedure is upheld, necessarily and obviously,
is sophistry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No less interesting than instructive and conclusive,
is reference of this question to those intellectual principles
which give birth to the game of Chess, <i>per se</i>, viz.:</p>

<p>As a primary fundamental, with the power to give
check, is associated concurrently the obligation upon
the King thus checked, not to remain in check.</p>

<p>Secondly: The totality of powers assigned to the
Chess-pieces is the ability to move, provided the King be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
free from check. This totality of powers may be denoted
by the indefinite symbol, X.</p>

<p>The play thus has for its object:</p>

<p>The reduction to zero of the adverse X, by the operation
of the kindred X.</p>

<p>This result is checkmate in its generalized form. In
effect, it is the destruction of the power of the adverse
pieces to move, by means of check made permanent.</p>

<p>By the law of continuity it is self-evident that:</p>

<p>The power to move appertaining either to White or to
Black, runs from full power to move any piece (a power
due to freedom from check), down to total inability to
move any piece, due to his King being permanently
checked, <i>i.e.</i>, checkmated.</p>

<p>This series cannot be interrupted without obvious
violation of the ethics of the game; because, so long as
any part of X remains, the principle from which the
series emanated still operates, and this without regard
to quantity of X remaining unexpended.</p>

<p>Thus, a game of Chess is a procedure from total ability
to total disability; <i>i.e.</i>, from one logical whole to another;
otherwise, from X to zero.</p>

<p>Checkmate, furnishes the limit to the series; the game
and X vanish together.</p>

<p>This is in perfect keeping with the law of continuity,
which acts and dominates from beginning to end of the
series, and so long as any part of X remains.</p>

<p>Hence to permit either White or Black to move any
piece, leaving his King in check, is an anomaly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Denial to the Pawn of ability to move to the rear is an
accurate interpretation of military ethics.</p>

<p>Of those puerile hypotheses common to the man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
does not know, one of the most entrancing to the popular
mind, is the notion that Corps d’armee properly are of
equal numbers and of the same composition.</p>

<p>This supposition is due to ignorance of the fact that
the multifarious duties of applied Strategetics, require
for their execution like variety of instruments, which
diversity of means is strikingly illustrated by the differing
movements of the Chess-pieces.</p>

<p>The inability of the Pawn to move backward strategically
harmonizes with its functions as a Corps of Position,
in contradiction to the movements of the pieces,
which latter are Corps of Evolution.</p>

<p>This restriction in the move of the Pawn is in exact
harmony with the inability of the Queen to move on
obliques, of the Rook to move on obliques or on diagonals,
of the Bishop to move on obliques, verticals and
horizontals, of the Knight to move on diagonals, verticals,
and horizontals, and of the King to move like any
other piece.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Possessed of the invaluable privilege of making the
first move in the game, knowing that no move should
be made without an object, understanding that the true
object of every move is to minimize the adverse power
for resistance and comprehending that all power for
resistance is derived from facility of movement, the
student easily deduces the true object of White’s initial
move in every game of Chess, viz.:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>To make the first of a series of movements, each of which
shall increase the mobility of the kindred pieces and correspondingly
decrease the mobility of the adverse pieces.</i></p>

<p>As the effect of such policy, the power for resistance
appertaining to Black, ultimately must become so insufficient
that he no longer will be able adequately to
defend:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. His base of operations.</li>
<li>2. The communications of his army with its base.</li>
<li>3. The communications of his corps d’armee with
each other, or,</li>
<li>4. To prevent the White hypothetical force penetrating
to its Logistic Horizon.</li>
</ul>

<p>To produce this fatal weakness in the Black position
by the advantage of the first move is much easier for
White than commonly is supposed.</p>

<p>The process consists in making only those movements
by means of which the kindred corps d’armee, progressively
occupying specified objectives, are advanced,
viz.:</p>

<ul>
<li>I. <i>To the Strategetic Objective, when acting against the
communications of the adverse Determinate Force and its
Base of Operations.</i></li>
<li>II. <i>To the Logistic Horizon, when acting against the
communications between the adverse Determinate and the
adverse Hypothetical Forces.</i></li>
<li>III. <i>To the Strategic Vertices, when acting against the
communications of the hostile corps d’armee with each other.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>To bring about either of these results against an opponent
equally equipped and capable, of course is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
much more difficult task than to checkmate an enemy
incapable of movement.</p>

<p>Yet such achievement is possible to White and with
exact play it seemingly is a certainty that he succeeds in
one or the other, owing to his inestimable privilege of
first move.</p>

<p>For the normal advantage that attaches to the first
move in a game of Chess is vastly enhanced by a peculiarity
in the mathematical make-up of the surface of the
Chess-board, whereby, he who makes the first move may
secure to himself the advantage in mobility, and conversely
may inflict upon the second player a corresponding
disadvantage in mobility.</p>

<p>This peculiar property emanates from this fact:</p>

<p><i>The sixty-four points, i.e., the sixty-four centres of the
squares into which the surface of the Chess-board is divided,
constitute, when taken collectively, the quadrant of a circle,
whose radius is eight points in length.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Hence, in Chessic mathematics, the sides of the Chessboard
do not form a square, but the segment of a circumference.</p>

<p>To prove the truth of this, one has but to count the
points contained in the verticals and horizontals and in
the hypothenuse of each corresponding angle, and in
every instance it will be found that the number of points
contained in the base, perpendicular, and hypothenuse,
is the same.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Let the eight points of the King’s Rook’s file form the
perpendicular of a right angle triangle, of which the
kindred first horizontal forms the base; then, the hypothenuse
of the given angle, will be that diagonal which
extends from QR1 to KR8. Now, merely by the processes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of simple arithmetic, it may be shown that there
are,</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Eight points in the base.</li>
<li>2. Eight points in the perpendicular.</li>
<li>3. Eight points in the hypothenuse.</li>
</ul>

<p>Consequently the <i>three</i> sides of this given right angled
triangle are <i>equal</i> to each other, which is a geometric
<i>impossibility</i>.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is self-evident that there exists a mathematical
incongruity in the surface of the Chess-board.</p>

<p>That is, what to the eye <i>seems</i> a right angled triangle,
is in its relations to the <i>movements</i> of the Chess-pieces,
an equilateral triangle. Hence, the Chess-board, in its
relations to the pieces when the latter are at <i>rest</i>, properly
may be regarded as a great <i>square</i> sub-divided into sixty-four
smaller squares; but on the contrary, in those calculations
relating to the Chess-pieces in <i>motion</i>, the
Chess-board must be regarded as the <i>quadrant</i> of a circle
of eight points radius. The demonstration follows, viz.:</p>

<p>Connect by a straight line the points KR8 and QR8.
Connect by another straight line the points QR8 and
QR1. Connect each of the fifteen points through which
these lines pass with the point KR1, by means of lines
passing through the least number of points intervening.</p>

<p>Then the line KR8 and QR8 will represent the segment
of a circle of which latter the point KR1 is the center.
The lines KR1-KR8 and KR1-QR1 will represent the
sides of a quadrant contained in the given circle and
bounded by the given segment, and the lines drawn from
KR1 to the fifteen points contained in the given segment
of the given circumference, will be found to be fifteen
equal radii each eight points in length.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having noted the form of the Static or positional surface
of the Chess-board and its relations to the pieces at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
rest, and having established the configuration of the
Dynamic surface upon which the pieces move, it is next
in sequence to deduce that fundamental fact and to give
it that geometric expression which shall mathematically
harmonize these conflicting geometric figures in their
relations to Chess-play.</p>

<p>As the basic fact of applied Chessic forces, it is to be
noted, that:</p>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>The King is the SOURCE from whence the Chess-pieces
derive all power of movement; and from his ability to
move, emanates ALL power for attack and for defence
possessed by a Chessic army.</i></p>

<p>This faculty of mobility, derived from the existence of
the kindred King, is the all essential element in Chess-play,
and to increase the mobility of the kindred pieces
and to reduce that of the adverse pieces is the simple, sure
and only scientific road to victory; and by comparison
of the Static with the Dynamic surface of the Chess-board,
the desired principle readily is discovered, viz.,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Static surface of the Chess-board being a square,
its least division is into two great right angled triangles
having a common hypothenuse.</p>

<p>The Dynamic surface being the quadrant of a circle,
its least division also is into two great sections, one of
which is a right angled triangle and the other a semi-circle.</p>

</div>

<p>Comparing the two surfaces of the Chess-board thus
divided, it will be seen that these three great right angled
triangles are equal, each containing thirty-six points;
and having for their common vertices, the points KR1,
QR1 and R8.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it will be seen that the hypothenuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
common to these triangles, also is the chord of that
semi-circle which appertains to the Dynamic surface.</p>

<p>Again, it will be perceived that this semi-circle, like
the three right angled triangles, is composed of thirty-six
points, and consequently that all of the four sub-divisions
of the Static and Dynamic surfaces of the Chess-board
are equal.</p>

<p>Thus it obviously follows, that:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. The great central diagonal, always is one side of
each of the four chief geometric figures into which the
Chess board is divided; that:</li>
<li>2. It mathematically perfects each of these figures
and harmonizes each to all, and that:</li>
<li>3. By means of it each figure becomes possessed of
eight more points than it otherwise would contain.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hence, the following is self-evident:</p>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>That Chessic army which can possess itself of the great
central diagonal, thereby acquires the larger number of
points upon which to act and consequently greater facilities
for movement; and conversely:</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><i>By the loss of the great central diagonal, the mobility of
the opposing army is correspondingly decreased.</i></p>

<p>It therefore is clear that the object of any series of
movements by a Chessic army acting otherwise than on
Line of Operations, should be:</p>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>Form the kindred army upon the hypothenuse of the right
angled triangle which is contained within the Dynamic surface
of the Chess-board; and conversely,</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Compel the adverse army to act exclusively within that
semi-circle which appertains to the same surface.</i></p>

<p>Under these circumstances, the kindred corps will be
possessed of facilities for movement represented by thirty-six
squares; while the logistic area of the opposing army
will be restricted to twenty-eight squares.</p>

<p>There are, of course, two great central diagonals of the
Chess-board; but as the student is fully informed that
great central diagonal always is to be selected, which
extends towards the Objective Plane.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mobility, <i>per se</i>, increases or decreases with the number
of squares open to occupation.</p>

<p>But in all situations there will be points of no value,
while other points are of value inestimable; for the reason
that the occupation of the former will not favorably affect
the play, or may even lose the game; while by the occupation
of the latter, victory is at once secured.</p>

<p>But it is not the province of Mobility to pass on the
values of points; this latter is the duty of Strategy. It is
sufficient for Mobility that it provide superior facilities
for movement; it is for Strategy to define the Line of
Movement; for Logistics, by means of this Line of
Movement, to bring into action in proper times and
sequence, the required force, and for Tactics, with this
force, to execute the proper evolutions.</p>

<p>Mobility derives its importance from three things
which may occur severally or in combination, viz.:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. All power for offense or for defense is eliminated
from a Chess-piece the instant it loses its ability to move.</li>
<li>2. The superiority possessed by corps acting offensively
over adverse corps acting defensively, resides in
that the attack of a piece is valid at every point which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
menaces; while the defensive effort of a piece, as a rule,
is valid only at a single point. Consequently:</li>
</ul>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>Increased facilities for movement enhance the power of
attacking pieces in a much greater degree than like facilities
enhance the power of defending pieces.</i></p>

<p>Such increasing facilities for movement ultimately
render an attacking force irresistible, for the reason that
it finally becomes a physical impossibility for the opposing
equal force to provide valid defences for the numerous
tactical keys, which at a given time become simultaneously
assailed. Hence:</p>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>Superior facilities for occupying any point at any time
and with any force, always ensure the superior force at a
given point, at a given time.</i></p>

<p>The relative advantage in mobility possessed by one
army over an opposing army always can be determined
by the following, viz.:</p>

<h3>RULE</h3>

<p class="hanging">1. That army whose strategic front of operations is
established upon the Strategetic Center has the relative
advantage in Mobility.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. To utilize the advantage in Mobility extend the
Strategic Front in the direction of the objective plane.</p>

<p class="hanging">3. To neutralize the relative disadvantage in Mobility
eliminate that adverse Corps d’armee which tactically
expresses such adverse advantage; or so post the Prime
Strategetic Point as to vitiate the adverse Strategic front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Advantage in Mobility is divided into two classes, viz.:</p>

<ul>
<li>I. General Advantage in Mobility.</li>
<li>II. Special Advantage in Mobility.</li>
</ul>

<p>A General Advantage in Mobility consists in the
ability to act simultaneously against two or more vital
points by means of interior logistic radii due to position
between:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1. The adverse army and its Base of Operations.</li>
<li>2. Two or more adverse Grand Columns.</li>
<li>3. The wings of a hostile Grand Column.</li>
<li>4. Two or more isolated adverse Corps d’armee.</li>
</ul>

<p>Such position upon interior lines of movement is
secured by occupying either of the Prime Offensive Origins,
<i>i.e.</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Strategic Center <i>vs.</i> Adverse Formation in Mass.</li>
<li>2. Logistic Center <i>vs.</i> Adverse Formation by Grand
Columns.</li>
<li>3. Tactical Center <i>vs.</i> Adverse Formation by Wings.</li>
<li>4. Logistic Triune <i>vs.</i> Adverse Formation by Corps.</li>
</ul>

<p>Special Advantage in Mobility consists in the ability
of a corps d’armee to traverse greater or equal distances
in lesser times than opposing corps.</p>

<p>Humanity is divisible into two groups, one of which
relatively is small and the other, by comparison, very
large.</p>

<p>The first of these groups is made up comparatively of
but a few persons, who, by virtue of circumstances are
possessed of everything except adequate physical
strength; and the second group consists of those vast
multitudes of mankind, which are destitute of everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
except of incalculable prowess, due to their overwhelming
numbers.</p>

<p>Hence, at every moment of its existence, organized
Society is face to face with the possibility of collision into
the Under World; and because of the knowledge that
such encounter is inevitable, unforeseeable and perhaps
immediately impending, Civilization, so-called, ever is
beset by an unspeakable and all-corroding fear.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To deter a multitude, destitute of everything except the
power to take, from despoiling by means of its irresistible
physique, those few who are possessed of everything except
ability to defend themselves, in all Ages has been the
chiefest problem of mankind; and to the solution of this
problem has been devoted every resource known to Education,
Legislation, Ecclesiasticism and Jurisprudence.</i></p>

<p>This condition further is complicated by a peculiar
outgrowth of necessary expedients, always more or less
unstable, due to that falsity of premise in which words
do not agree with acts.</p>

<p>Of these expedients the most incongruous is the arming
and training of the children of the mob for the protection
of the upper stratum; and that peculiar mental insufficiency
of hoi polloi, whereby it ever is induced to accept
as its leaders the sons of the Patrician class.</p>

<p>That a social structure founded upon such anomalies
should endure, constitutes in itself the real Nine Wonders
of the World; and is proof of that marvellous ingenuity
with which the House of Have profits by the chronic
predeliction of the House of Want to fritter away time

<p><i>The advantage in Numbers consists in having in the
aggregate more Corps d’armee than has the adversary.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>All benefit to be derived from the advantage in Numbers
is limited to the active and scientific use of every
corp d’armee; otherwise excess of Numbers, not only
is of no avail, but easily may degenerate into fatal disadvantage
by impeding the decisive action of other
kindred corps. Says Napoleon: “It is only the troops
brought into action, that avails in battles and campaigns&mdash;the
rest does not count.”</p>

<p>A loss in Numbers at chess-play occurs only when two
pieces are lost for one, or three for two, or one for none,
and the like. No diminution in aggregate of force can
take place on the Chess-board, so long as the number of
the opposing pieces are equal.</p>

<p>This is true although all the pieces on one side are
Queens and those of the other side all Pawns.</p>

<p>The reason for this is:</p>

<p>All the Chess-pieces are equal in strength, one to the
other. The Pawn can overthrow and capture any piece&mdash;the
Queen can do no more.</p>

<p>That is to say, at its turn to move, any piece can capture
any adverse piece; and this is all that any piece can
do.</p>

<p>It is true that the Queen, on its turn to move, has a
maximum option of twenty-seven squares, while the
Pawn’s maximum never is more than three. But as the
power of the Queen can be exerted only upon one point,
obviously, her observation of the remaining twenty-six
points is merely a manifestation of mobility, and her
display of force is limited to a single square. Hence, the
result in each case is identical, and the display of force
equal.</p>

<p>Bonaparte, with 30,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry and 40
cannon, invaded Italy, (March 26, 1796) which was
defended by 100,000 Piedmontese and Austrian regulars
under Generals Colli and Beaulieu. In fifteen days he
had captured the former, driven the latter to his own
country and compelled Piedmont to sign a treaty of
peace and alliance with France.</p>

<p>At Castiglione, Arcole, Bassano and Rivoli, with an
army not exceeding 40,000 men Bonaparte destroyed
four Austrian armies, each aggregating about 100,000

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At Wagram, Napoleon, with less than 100,000 men,
overthrew the main Austrian army of 150,000 men,
foiled the attempts at succor of the secondary Austrian
army of 40,000 men, and compelled Austria to accept
peace with France.</p>

<p>In the campaign of 1814, Napoleon, with never more
than 70,000 men, twice repulsed from the walls of Paris
and drove backward nearly to the Rhine River an allied
army of nearly 300,000 Austrians, Prussians and Russians.</p>

<p>In the year 480 B.C., Xerxes, King of Persia, invaded
Greece with an army, which by Herodotus, Plutarch and
Isocrates, is estimated at 2,641,610 men at arms and
exclusive of servants, butlers, women and camp followers.</p>

<p>Arriving at the Pass of Thermopolae, the march of the
invaders was arrested by Leonidas, King of Sparta,
with an army made up of 300 Spartans, 400 Thebans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
700 Thespians, 1,000 Phocians and 3,000 from various
Grecian States, posted behind a barricade built across
the entrance.</p>

<p>This celebrated defile is about a mile in length. It
runs between Mount Oeta and an impassible morass,
which forms the edge of the Gulf of Malia and at each
end is so narrow that a wagon can barely pass.</p>

<p>Xerxes at once sent a herald who demanded of the
Grecians the surrender of their arms, to which Leonidas
replied:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Come and take them.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>On the fifth day the Persian army attacked, but was
unable to force an entrance into the pass. On the sixth
day the Persian Immortals likewise were repulsed, and on
the seventh day these troops again failed.</p>

<p>That night Ephialtes, a Malian, informed Xerxes of a
foot path around the mountains to the westward, and a
Persian detachment was sent by a night march en
surprise against the Grecian rear. On the approach of
this hostile body, the Phocians, who had been detailed
by Leonidas to guard this path, abandoned their post
without fighting and fled to the summit of the mountains,
leaving the way open to the enemy, who, wasting no
time in pursuit, at once marched against the rear of the
Grecian position.</p>

<p>At the command of Leonidas, all his allies, with the
exception of the 700 Thespians, who refused to leave
him, abandoned Thermopolae in haste and returned
safely to their own countries.</p>

<p>Xerxes waited until day was well advanced and his
detachment had taken post upon the Grecian rear.
Then both Persian columns attacked simultaneously.
The first part of this final conflict was fought outside
and to the north of the barricade. Leonidas being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
slain and their numbers reduced over half, the remaining
Greeks retired behind the barricade and took post upon
a slight elevation, where one after another they were
killed by arrows and javelins. The four days of fighting
cost the Persians over 20,000 of their best troops.</p>

<p>Upon the summit of the hill where the Spartans perished
a marble lion was erected, bearing the inscription:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Go tell the Lacedymonians, O, Stranger,</div>
<div class="verse">That we died here in obedience to the law.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A second inscription engraved upon a stone column
erected upon the scene of conflict read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Upon this spot four thousand Pelleponesians contended
against three hundred myriads.”</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The largest army commanded by Epaminondas was
about 70,000 men. Alexander the Great, after Arbela,
had 135,000 trained troops. Hannibal never led more
than 60,000 men in action, nor Caesar more than 80,000.
Gustavus Adolphus, just before Lutzen, marshalled
75,000 of the best soldiers in the world under the banners
of Protestantism. Turenne never fought with more
than 40,000 troops; Prince Eugene often had 150,000
in hand, and Frederic the Great several times commanded
200,000 men. At Yorktown, Washington had 16,000
Continentals, 6,000 French regulars and 18,000 Provincial
volunteers: Napoleon’s largest army, that of the
Austerlitz campaign, consisted of 180,000 men, while
von Moltke personally directed at Sadowa, 250,000 men;
at Gravelotte, 211,000 men and at Sedan, 200,000 men.</p>

<h2>TIME</h2>

<div class="quote">

<p><i>“That greatest of all advantages&mdash;TIME!”&mdash;Frederic the Great.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p><i>“Ask me for anything except&mdash;TIME.”&mdash;Napoleon.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p><i>“Time is the cradle of hope, the grave of ambition, the
solitary counsel of the wise and the stern corrector of fools.
Wisdom walks before it, opportunities with it and repentance
behind it. He that hath made it his friend hath
nothing to fear from his enemies, but he that hath made it
his enemy hath little to hope even from his friends.”&mdash;Anon.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="hanging"><i>The absolute advantage of Time consists in being able to
move while the adversary must remain stationary.</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><i>The conditioned advantage in Time i.e., the Initiative,
consists in artificially restricting the adverse ability to move.</i></p>

<p>Advantage in Time is divided into two classes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I. The Initiative.</li>
<li>II. Absolute.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Initiative treats of restrictions to the movements
of an army, due to the necessity of supporting, covering
or sustaining Points or corps d’armee, menaced with
capture by adverse corps offensive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>The absolute advantage in Time is the ability to move,
while the adverse army must remain immovable.</p>

<p>Whenever the right to move is unrestricted, any desired
Piece may be moved to any desired Point.</p>

<p>But whenever the right to move is restricted it follows
that the Piece desired cannot be moved; or, that if
moved it cannot be moved to the desired Point; or, that a
piece not desired, must be moved and usually to a Point
not desired.</p>

<p>Such restrictions of the right to move, quickly produce
fatal defects in the kindred Formation; and from
the fact that such fatal defects in Formation can be produced
by restricting the right to move, arises the inestimable
value of the advantage in Time.</p>

<p>Perfection in Time is attained whenever the kindred
army is able to move while the hostile army must remain
stationary.</p>

<p>The object of the active or absolute advantage in
Time always is to remain with the Initiative, or Passive
Advantage in Time; which consists in operating by the
movement made, such menaces, as compel the enemy:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. To move corps d’armee which he otherwise would
not move and</li>
<li>2. Prevents him from moving corps d’armee which
he otherwise would move.</li>
</ul>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>Given superior brute strength and no matter how blunderingly
and clumsily it be directed, it always will end by
accomplishing its purpose, unless it is opposed by Skill.</i></p>

<p>Skill is best manifested by the proper use of Time.
Such ability is acquired only through study and experience,
guided by reflection, and it can be retained only
by systematic and unremitting practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Most people imagine that Skill is to be attained merely
from study; many believe it but the natural and necessary
offshoot of long experience; and there are some of the
opinion that dilettante dabbling in book lore is an all-sufficient
substitute for that sustained and laborious
mental and physical effort, which alone can make perfect
in the competitive arts.</p>

<p>Only by employing his leisure in reflection upon the
events of the Past can one get to understand those
things which make for success in Warfare and in Chessplay,
and develop that all-essential ability to detect
equivalents in any situation.</p>

<p>For in action there is no time for such reflection, much
less for development.</p>

<p>Then, moments of value inestimable for the achieving
of results are not to be wasted in the weighing and comparison
of things, whose relative importance should be
discerned in the twinkling of an eye, by reason of prior
familiarity with similar conditions.</p>

<p>The relative advantage in time possessed by one army
over an opposing army always can be determined by the
following, viz.:</p>

<h3>RULE</h3>

<ul>
<li>1. <i>That army which is in motion while the opposing
army must remain stationary has the absolute advantage in
Time.</i></li>
<li>2. <i>That army which although at rest can dictate the
movement of an opposing army in motion has the conditioned
advantage in Time, i.e., the Initiative.</i></li>

Napoleon’s army marched at the rate of 30 miles per day,
besides fighting a battle every 24 hours. Retrograding
for the succor of Paris, Napoleon marched 75 miles in
thirty-six hours. On the return from Elba, 1815, the

<p>By the term Position is signified those relative advantages
and disadvantages in location, which appertain
to the aggregate posts occupied by the kindred army, as
compared with the aggregate posts occupied by the adverse
army.</p>

<p>Advantages and disadvantages in Position are of three

<h3>STRATEGETIC SITUATIONS</h3>

<p>A Strategic Situation, and whether in warfare or in
Chess-play, is produced by the presence, in any Strategetic
Plane, <i>i.e.</i>, theatre of conflict, of two or more opposing
Strategetic Entireties, <i>i.e.</i>, contending armies.</p>

<p>These latter are of four classifications and are denominated
as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>(a) The Kindred Determinate Force.</li>
<li>(b) The Adverse Determinate Force.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></li>
<li>(c) The Kindred Hypothetical Force.</li>
<li>(d) The Adverse Hypothetical Force.</li>
</ul>

<h4>RULE I</h4>

<p class="hanging"><i>Given the Strategetic Entireties present in a given Strategetic
Situation, designate the opposing Prime Strategetic
Factors and express the relative values of each in the terms of
the Strategic Syllogism.</i></p>

<h5>THE STRATEGIC SYLLOGISM</h5>

<p>Having classified the existing Strategetic Situation, it
is necessary next to designate the opposing Columns of
Attack, of Support, and of Manoeuvre.</p>

<p>Then, by comparing these Prime Strategetic Factors,
to determine the net advantage, disadvantage, or equality
that exist between them and to express this condition in
the terms of the resulting Strategic Syllogism.</p>

<p>In the construction of a Strategic Syllogism, the
Strategic, <i>i.e.</i>, the positional value of each of the opposing
Prime Strategetic Factors contained in a given Strategetic
Situation, is expressed in terms made up of letters
and symbols, viz.,</p>

<table summary="Explanation of the notation">

    <td><span class="ditto">”</span></td>
    <td>Equality in Position.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The positional values of the several Prime Strategetic
Factors are obtained as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<h6>COLUMN OF ATTACK</h6>

<p>That Column of Attack which is posted upon the superior
Strategic front as compared to the front occupied by
the immediately opposing formation (cf, Grand Tactics,
pp. 117 to 275), has the advantage in position.</p>

<p>This relative advantage and disadvantage in position
of the Column of Attack is expressed by the first term of
the Strategic Syllogism, viz.:</p>

<p class="center">(I.)</p>

<table summary="Relative advantage and disadvantage in position of the Column of Attack">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">+A</td>

    <td class="tdr">-A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="bt tdr">+A</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>In the first instance (I), the White Column of Attack
has the advantage and the Black formation has the
disadvantage; in the second case (II), this condition is
reversed.</p>

<h6>COLUMN OF SUPPORT</h6>

<p>A Column of Support has the superiority in position,
as compared with the adverse Column of Support,
whenever it contains more than the latter of the following
advantages, viz.:</p>

<ul>
<li>I. One, or more, Passed Pawns.</li>
<li>II. Two united Pawns, overlapping an adverse Pawn.</li>
<li>III. Two isolated Pawns adjacent to a single adverse
Pawn.</li>
<li>IV. Three, or more, united Pawns at their fifth
squares, opposed by a like number of adverse
Pawns posted on their Normal Base Line.</li>
<li>V. A majority of kindred Pawns on that side of the
Board farthest from the adverse King.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The relative advantage and disadvantage of one Column
of Support, over the opposing Column of Support,
is expressed by the second term of the Strategic Syllogism,
thus:</p>

<p class="center">(I.)</p>

<table summary="Relative advantage and disadvantage in position of the Column of Support">

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="bt tdr">+S</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>In the first case (I), White has the advantage and
Black has the disadvantage. In the second case (II),
this condition is reversed.</p>

<h6>COLUMN OF MANOEUVRE</h6>

<p>Columns of Manoeuvre are not compared with each
other. The advantage of one over another is determined
by comparing their respective powers of resistance to the
attack of the corresponding adverse Columns of Support.</p>

<p>That Column of Manoeuvre which longest can debar
the adverse promotable Factors from occupying a point
of junction on the kindred Strategetic Rear, has the advantage.</p>

<p>The relative advantage and disadvantage of the column
of Manoeuvre is expressed by the third term of the
Strategic Syllogism, viz.:</p><p class="center">(I.)</p>

<table summary="Relative advantage and disadvantage in position of the Column of Manoeuvre">

<h5><i>STRATEGIC ELEMENTALS.</i></h5>

<p class="hanging"><i>Each of the terms contained in the Strategic Syllogism
should have its counterpart in a tangible and competent
mass of troops.</i></p>

<p>This principle of Strategetics, when applied to warfare,
is absolute, and admits of no exception. The catastrophies
sustained by the French armies in the campaigns
of 1812, 1813, 1814 and 1815 are each and every one
directly due to the persistent violation by Napoleon of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
this basic truth, in devolving the duties of a column of
support and a column of manoeuvre upon a single Strategic
Elemental.</p>

<p>In solemn contrast to that fatal and indefensible rashness
which cost Napoleon five great armies and ultimately
his crown, is the dictum by one whose transcendent
success in warfare, is the antithesis of the utter
ruination which terminated the career of the famous
Corsican.</p>

<p>Says Frederic the Great:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>I adhere to those universal laws which all the elements
obey; these, for me are sufficient.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>Singularly enough, it seemingly has escaped the notice
of the great in warfare, owing to the subtle mathematical
construction of the Chess-board, its peculiar relations
to the moves of the Chess-pieces, and of the latter
to each other, that:</p>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging">I. <i>The functions of all three terms contained in a
Strategic Syllogism may be combined in a single chess
Pawn, and, that:</i></p>

<p class="hanging">II. <i>All three functions are contemplated in and should
be expressed by every movement of every Chess-piece; and
every move upon the Chess-board is weak and unscientific, to
the extent that it disregards either of these obligations.</i></p>

<p>Those advantages in position, which are denoted by
the plus signs of the Strategic Syllogism, have their
material manifestation upon the surface of the earth by
Corps d’armee, and by Pieces which are equivalents of
these latter, upon the Chess-board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>sign +A in the Strategic Syllogism</i> denotes the
superior Strategic Front. That point whose occupation
by a kindred piece demonstrates such superiority in
position is termed the <i>Key of Position</i>. The kindred
Corps occupying such point constitutes a <i>Corps en Line</i>,
and is termed the <i>First Strategic Elemental</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>sign +S in the Strategic Syllogism</i> denotes the
<i>larger number</i> of pawn altitudes open to the kindred
promotable factors. Those points occupied by such
kindred promotable factors are termed <i>Logistic Origins</i>.
The kindred Corps which occupy such points constitute
<i>Corps en Route</i> and collectively are termed the <i>Second
Strategic Elemental</i>. The objective of Corps en Route
always is the Kindred Logistic Horizon.</p>

<p>The <i>sign +M in the Strategic Syllogism</i> denotes that
the <i>shortest</i> open pawn altitude is occupied by a kindred
promotable factor. Such kindred promotable factor is
termed the <i>Corps en Touch</i>, and the point occupied by
such Corps is termed the <i>Point of Proximity</i>. The
Objective of such Corps always is a designated Point
of Junction in the Kindred Logistic Horizon, and such
Corps constitutes the <i>Third Strategic Elemental</i>.</p>

<p>In Warfare it is imperative that each of these Strategic
Elementals be represented by one or more Corps d’armee.
But it is a second peculiarity of the Chessic mechanism
that a single Chessic Corps d’armee may represent in
itself, one, two or three Strategic Elementals and thus
constitute even the entire <i>Strategic Ensemble</i>.</p>

<p>Hence, in Chess play, the Strategic Ensemble may be
either single, double, or triple, viz.:</p>

<p>A Single Strategic Ensemble consists either of:</p>

<ul>
<li>(a) 1. Major Vertex.</li>
<li class="isub1">2. Grand Vertex.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></li>
<li>(b) Logistic Origin.</li>
<li>(c) Point of Proximity.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <i>Double Strategic Ensemble</i> consists of either:</p>

<ul>
<li>(a) 1. Major Vertex, plus a Kindred Logistic Origin.</li>
<li class="isub1">2. Grand Vertex, plus a Kindred Logistic Origin.</li>
<li>(b) 1. Major Vertex, plus a Kindred Point of Proximity.</li>
<li class="isub1">2. Grand Vertex, plus a Kindred Point of Proximity.</li>
<li>(c) Logistic Origin, plus a Kindred Point of Proximity.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <i>Triple Strategic Ensemble</i> consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Major Vertex, plus a Kindred Logistic Origin, plus
a Kindred Point of Proximity.</li>
<li>2. Grand Vertex, plus a Kindred Point of Proximity,
plus a Kindred Logistic Origin.</li>
</ul>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>The relative positional advantage expressed by the plus
signs of the Strategic Syllogism decreases as the number of
plus signs in the Strategic Syllogism exceeds the number of
corresponding Strategic Elementals.</i></p>

<p>Failure to observe the amalgamation of the duties of
the three Grand Columns in each and every move upon
the Chess-board, and to note that the tangible and material
expression of these powers and advantages may be
expressed either by three, by two, or even by a single
Chessic Corps d’armee, has caused doubt of the exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
analogy between Chess and War; and hence a like doubt
of the utility of Chess-play.</p>

<p>Recognizing the truth of the foregoing, the Asiatic
conqueror, Tamerlane, sought to rectify this discrepancy
between the mechanism of Chess and that of War, by
increasing the size of the Chess-board to one hundred
and forty-four squares, and the number of pieces to
forty-eight.</p>

<p>By this innovation the geometric harmony existing
between the Dynamic and the Static surfaces of the
Chess-board was destroyed; and this without substituting
therefor another like condition of mathematic perfection.
Ultimately, this remedy was abandoned, a fate which
sooner or later, has overtaken all attempts to improve
that superlative intellectual exercise of which says
Voltaire:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Of all games, Chess does most honor to the human
mind.”</p>

</div>

<p>The reason why the scheme devised by Tamerlane did
not satisfy even himself, and why all attempted alterations
in the machinery of Chess prove unacceptable in
practice, is due to the present perfect adaptation of the
Board and the Pieces for exemplifying the processes of
Strategetic Art.</p>

<p>Any change in the construction of the Chess-board and
the Chess-pieces, to be effective, must largely increase
the number of Chessmen, correspondingly increase the
number of squares, and equally so, increase the number of
moves permitted to each player at his turn to play.</p>

<p>That is to say: Such innovation to be correct must
permit each player at his turn to play to move one of the
Corps d’armee contained in the Column of Attack, a
second in the Column of Support, and a third in the
Column of Manoeuvre. Necessarily, the number of
pieces must be increased in order to provide Corps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
d’armee for the make-up of each Grand Column, and obviously,
the Board must be sufficiently enlarged to accommodate
not merely this increased mass, but also to
permit full scope for the increased number of possible
movements.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>The student thus readily will perceive, that it is only one
step from such an elaboration of Chess, to an army and
the theatre of actual campaigning.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Perfection in Position is attained whenever the kindred
army is acting or is posted as a unit, while the hostile
army is not so posted nor able so to act.</p>

<h3 id="POSITION_EXAMPLES">MILITARY EXAMPLES</h3>

<h4>COLUMN OF ATTACK</h4>

<div class="quote">

<p><i>“Frontal attacks are to be avoided, and the preference
always is to be given to the assault of a single wing, with
your center and remaining wing held back; because if your
attack is successful you equally destroy the enemy without
the risk of being routed if you fail.”&mdash;Frederic the Great.</i></p>

</div>

<p>At Leuctra and Mantinea, Epaminondas won by the
oblique or Strategic order of battle. Alexander the
Great won by the same order at Issus and the Haspades.
Cyrus won at Thymbra and Hannibal won at Trebia,
Thrasymene, Cannae and Herdonea, by the three sides
of an octagon or enveloping formation. Caesar won by
the oblique order at Pharsaleus.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Gustavus Adolphus won at Leipsic by acting from the
Tactical Center and Turenne and Prince Eugene gained
their victories by the same means.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Frederic the Great won at Hohenfriedberg, Sohr,
Rosbach, Leuthern, Zorndorf and Leignitz by the oblique
order and at Torgau by acting from the tactical center.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Washington won at Trenton and Princeton acting by
three contiguous sides of an octagon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Bonaparte won at Montenotte, Castiglione, Arcola,
Rivoli, Ulm, Austerlitz, Jena, Friedland, Wagram and
Ligny, by acting from the tactical center. Never did
he attack by the oblique order of battle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Von Moltke’s victories all were won by acting in strict
accord with the system laid down for the use of the
Prussian army by Frederic the Great.</p>

<h4>COLUMN OF SUPPORT</h4>

<p>The most magnificent illustration both of the proper
and of the improper use of the Column of Support is
found in that Grand Operation executed by the Roman
consuls, Claudius Nero and Marcus Livius, whereby
the Carthagenian Army under Hasdrubal was destroyed
at the river Metaurus 207 B.C.</p>

<p>Hannibal, with the main Carthagenian army, posted
in the south of Italy near Canusium, was observed by
Nero and his troops; while in the west, Hasdrubal,
observed by Livius was slowly advancing southward to
form a junction with his brother, a most unscientific
procedure.</p>

<p>Livius permitted Hasdrubal to penetrate into Italy to a
point a few miles south of the Metaurus River; whereupon
Nero, taking 7,000 of his best troops, by a rapid march
of 200 miles united with Livius; and the two consuls at
once falling upon Hasdrubal utterly annihilated the
Carthagenian army. Nero returned at all speed and
the first news of his march and of the death blow to the
Carthagenian projects against Rome was furnished by
the sight of his brother’s head, which Nero cast into
Hannibal’s camp from a military machine.</p>

<p>The true method for uniting the Columns of Support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
to a Column of Attack is thus shown by Gustavus
Adolphus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We encamped about Nuremberg the middle of June,
the army after so many detachments was not above
11,000 infantry and 8,000 horse and dragoons. The
King posted his army in the suburbs and drew intrenchments
around the circumference so that he begirt the
whole city with his army. His works were large, the
ditch deep, planked by innumerable bastions, ravelins,
horn-works, forts, redoubts, batteries and palisades, the
incessant labor of 8000 men for fourteen days.</p>

<p>“On the 30th of June the Imperialists, joined to the
Bavarian army arrived and sat down 60,000 strong,
between the city and the friendly states; in order to
intercept the King’s provisions and to starve him out.</p>

<p>“The King had three great detachments and several
smaller ones, acting abroad, reducing to his power the
castles and towns of the adjacent countries and these he
did not hasten to join him until their work was done.</p>

<p>“The two chief armies had now lain for five or six
weeks in sight of each other and the King thinking all
was ready, ordered his generals to join him. Gustavus
Horn was on the Moselle, Chancellor Oxenstern about
Mentz and Cologne and Dukes William and Bernard
and Gen. Bannia in Bavaria.</p>

<p>“Our friends were not backward in obeying the King’s
command, and having drawn together their forces from
various parts and <i>ALL</i> joined the chancellor Oxenstern,
they set out in full march for Nuremburg, where they
arrived Aug. 21, being 30,000 old soldiers commanded
by officers of the greatest conduct and experience in the
world.”</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Only once, at the battle of Torgau, (Nov. 5, 1760)
did Frederick the Great rely upon the co-operation of his
Columns of Support for victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>As the result, his Column of Attack of 25,000 men
fought the entire battle and was so ruined by the fire and
sabres of 90,000 enemies and 400 pieces of artillery that,
as the sun went down the King charged at the head
of two battalions, his sole remaining troops. At this
moment Gen. Zeithen, with the Column of Support, of
22,000 men occupied Siptka Hill, the tactical key of the
battlefield, and fired a salvo of artillery to inform the
King of their presence. The astonished Austrians turned
and fled; the King’s charge broke their line of battle and
Frederic grasped a victory, “for which” says Napoleon,
“he was indebted to Fortune and the only one in which
he displayed no talent.”</p>

<p>This comment of course is not true. Frederic displayed
magnificent talent that day, by holding in check
a force of thrice his numbers and so shattering it by his
incessant attacks that it crumbled to pieces before the
mere presence and at sight of his fresh and vigorous
Column of Support. Had Napoleon displayed such
talent in the personal conduct of battles during 1813, 1814
and 1815 it is possible that he would have terminated his
career at some other place than at St. Helena.</p>

<p>The experience, however, was enough to fully satisfy
Frederic, and never again did he attempt a Logistic
battle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The capture of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown is perhaps
the nearest approach to the achievement of Nero
and Livius in the annals of the military art. Decoyed
by the retrograde movements of Gen. Greene, the British
army was deluded into taking up a position at Yorktown,
having the unfordable James River in rear, and within
striking distance of the main American army under
Washington about New York City.</p>

<p>Lafayette was ordered to reinforce Greene; Count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
d’Esting was induced to bring the French fleet from the
West Indies to Chesapeake Bay to prevent the rescue of
Cornwallis by British coming by the ocean, and Count
Rochambeau was requested to join Washington with the
French army then in Rhode Island.</p>

<p>All this took time, but everything was executed like
clockwork. The French fleet arrived in the Chesapeake;
the next day came a British fleet to rescue the Earl’s
army. In the naval fight which ensued, the British were
driven to sea and so damaged as to compel their return
to New York. By a swift march, Washington, with his
Continentals and the French, joined Greene and Lafayette,
and two of his redoubts being taken by storm,
Lord Cornwallis surrendered. This victory established
the independence of the American Colonies.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Logistic Battle, <i>i.e.</i>, the combination of the Columns
of Attack and of Support was first favorite with
Napoleon and to his partiality for this particular form
of the tactical offensive was due both the spectacular
successes and the annihilating catastrophes which mark
his astonishing career.</p>

<p>The retrieving of his lost battle of Marengo, by the
fortuitous arrival of Dessaix column, seems to have impressed
Napoleon to the extent that he ever after
preferred to win by such process, rather than by any
other.</p>

<p>The first attempt to put his new hypothesis into practice
was at Jena. Single handed his column of attack
destroyed the Prussian main body, while Davoust with
the column of manoeuvre held in check over three times
his numbers.</p>

<p>The French Column of Support under Bernadotte did
not arrive in season to fire a shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At Eylau, the French Column of Support under Davoust
was four hours in advancing six miles against the
opposition of the Russian general Doctoroff. The second
French Column of Support under Ney did not reach the
field until the battle was over.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the retreat from Russia, the French Column of
Support under the Duke of Belluno was driven from its
position at Smolensko, thus permitting the Russians
under Kutosof to occupy the Strategic center, which
disaster cost Napoleon 30,000 men in clearing his communications.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In 1813, the Column of Support under Ney at Bautzen
was misdirected and the battle rendered indecisive by its
lack of co-operation with the French Column of Attack.</p>

<p>In 1814, Napoleon conformed to the Art by acting in
three columns, but yielding to his besetting military sin,
he joined his Column of Support to his Column of Attack
and through the open space thus created in the French
Strategetic Front, Blucher advanced triumphantly to
Paris.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the Waterloo campaign, Napoleon properly began
with three Grand Columns. At the battle of Ligny, his
Column of Support arrived upon Blucher’s left flank and
then without firing a shot, wheeled about and marched
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>At Waterloo, by uniting his Columns of Attack and of
Support prematurely, Napoleon permitted Blucher to
penetrate the French Strategetic Front and to win in
the same manner and as decisively as he did at Paris.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Von Moltke won the battle of Sadowa by the arrival of
the Prussian Column of Support, commanded by Prince
Frederic William. But in the interim, the German main
army was driven in several miles by the Austrians, and
Prince Bismark’s first white hairs date from that day.</p>

<h4>COLUMN OF MANOEUVRE</h4>

<p><i>“A small body of brave and expert men, skillfully handled
and favored by the ground, easily may render difficult the
advance of a large army.”&mdash;Frederic the Great.</i></p>

</div>

<p>At the river Metaurus, the Roman Consul Livius gave
a fine example of the duties of a Column of Manoeuvre
which are slowly and securely to retreat before an advancing
enemy and never to be induced into a pitched
battle until the arrival of the kindred main body.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Frederic the Great made great use of Columns of
Manoeuvre. In the Seven Years War he constantly
maintained such a column against the armies of each
State with whom Prussia was at war; while himself and
his brother Henry operated as Columns of Attack.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the Revolutionary War, Washington maintained a
Column of Manoeuvre against the British in Rhode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Island, another against the British in the south and a
third against the hostile Indian tribes of the southwest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Napoleon constantly used Columns of Manoeuvre in
all his campaigns; notably at Montenotte, Castiglione,
Arcole, Rivoli, Ulm, Austerlitz, Jena, in 1812, 1813, 1814
and at Ligny and Waterloo in 1815.</p>

<h3>POLICY OF CAMPAIGN</h3>

<p>That relative advantage in Numbers expressed by the
larger aggregate of Chess-pieces is materially manifested
upon the Chess-board by additional geometric and sub-geometric
symbols.</p>

<p>Excess or deficiency in Numbers determines the policy
of Campaign. The policy of the inferior force is:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<ul>
<li>1. To preserve intact its Corps d’armee, and</li>
<li>2. To engage in battle only when victory can be
assured by other advantages in Strategetic means, which
nullify the adverse advantage in Numbers; and even then
only when such victory is decisive of the Campaign.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hence, the policy of Campaign of that army superior
in Numbers, is:</p>

<p>Incessantly to proffer battles which:</p>

<ul>
<li>(a) Accepted, constantly reduces the inferior army
and increases its disproportion in numbers, or,</li>
<li>(b) Evaded, compels the inferior army to abandon
important posts, for whose defence it cannot afford the resulting
loss of troops; thus permitting to the numerically
superior army a continually increasing advantage in
Position.</li>
</ul>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>All else being equal the advantage of Numbers is decisive
of victory in battle and Campaign.</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Things being unequal, the advantage in Numbers may
be nullified by adverse advantages in Organization, Topography,
Mobility, Time and Position.</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Victory resulting from advantage in Numbers is
achieved by simultaneously attacking two or more Tactical
Keys from a Kindred Strategic Key and two or more
Kindred Points of Command.</i></p>

<h4>TO LOCATE THE AREA OF
CONCENTRATION</h4>

<p>That <i>relative advantage in Mobility</i> expressed by the
situation of the Strategic Front upon the Strategetic
Center is materially manifested upon the Chess-board by
Kindred Chess-pieces posted upon that great central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
diagonal which extends towards the Objective Plane.
Such advantage determines those points which should be
occupied in the proper development of the front so posted;
and consequently designates the direction and location
of that battlefield upon which the kindred army may concentrate
in overwhelming force, despite all possible
resistance by the enemy.</p>

<h4>MOST FAVORABLE BATTLEFIELD</h4>

<p>That <i>relative advantage in Organization</i> expressed by
superior potential totality, is materially manifested upon
the Chess-board by the geometric and sub-geometric
symbols of those Chess-pieces possessed of the superior
potential complement. Such symbols taken in combination,
describe that field of battle most favorable for
the execution of those Major Tactical evolutions which
appertain to the Chess-pieces of superior organization.</p>

<h4>POSTS OF MAXIMUM SECURITY</h4>

<p>That <i>relative defensive advantage in Topography</i> expressed
by inaccessibility to hostile attack is materially
manifested upon the Chess-board by Corps of Position,
posted upon points of different color to that occupied
by the adverse Bishop; and this advantage designates
those posts situated on a projected field of battle which
may be occupied with the maximum of security.</p>

<p>That <i>relative offensive advantage in Topography</i> expressed
by accessibility to kindred attack is materially
manifested upon the Chess-board by Corps of Position
posted upon points of the same color as that occupied
by the kindred Bishop; and this advantage designates
those posts situated on a projected field of battle which
may be attacked with the maximum facility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<h4>CHARACTER OF THE MOST FAVORABLE
BATTLE</h4>

<p>That <i>relative advantage in Position with the Column of
Attack</i>, expressed:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. By superior location, direction and development
of the Kindred Strategic Front of Operations; and</li>
<li>2. By the occupation of Points of Departure, of
Manoeuvre, of Command and of the Strategic Key of a
True Strategic Horizon, indicates that a Strategic Grand
Battle in the first instance; and in the second case that a
Tactical Grand Battle is most favorable in the existing
situation.</li>
</ul>

<p>That <i>relative advantage in Position with the Column of
Support</i>, expressed by superior facilities for occupying
with the Kindred Promotable Factors their corresponding
Points of Junction in the Kindred Logistic Horizon,
is materially manifested upon the Chess-board by the
larger number of Pawn Altitudes which either are open,
or may be opened, despite all possible resistance
by the enemy; and such advantage designates those
adverse Points of Impenetrability and Points of Resistance
to the march of the Kindred Promotable Factors,
which it is necessary to nullify.</p>

<p>That <i>relative advantage in Position with the Column of
Manoeuvre</i>, expressed by the security of the Kindred and
the exposure of the adverse Strategetic Rear to attack
by the Kindred Column of Support, is materially manifested
upon the Chess-board by the occupation by a
Kindred Promotable Factor of the Point of Proximity;
and such advantage indicates that the advance with all
possible celerity of such Promotable Factor and Point
of Proximity toward the corresponding Point of Junction
is a dominating influence in the existing situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<h4>PROJECTED GRAND BATTLE</h4>

<p>From the advantage in Position appertaining to the
three Grand Columns is deduced the character of the
Grand Battle properly in sequence.</p>

<p><i>Advantage in Position with the Column of Attack</i> indicates
the opportunity, all else being equal, to engage in a
victorious Strategic Grand Battle against the hostile
Formation in Mass, or in a Tactical Grand Battle against
the hostile Formation by Wings.</p>

<p><i>Advantage in Position with the Column of Support</i>
indicates the opportunity to engage effectively in a series
of minor battles, as though having the advantage in
Numbers.</p>

<p><i>Advantage in Position with the Column of Manoeuvre</i>
indicates the opportunity to engage in a victorious
Logistic Grand Battle against the adverse Formation
by Grand Columns.</p>

<h4>LEAST FAVORABLE ADVERSE CONDITION</h4>

<p>That <i>relative advantage in Time</i> expressed by restrictions
of the adversary’s choice of movements at his turn
to play, is materially manifested upon the Chess-board by
Feints operated by Kindred Chess-pieces against adverse
vital points; and such advantage of the Initiative dictates
the next move of the opposing army.</p>

<p>The <i>advantage of the Initiative</i> determines which of the
adverse corps d’armee may and may not move.</p>

<p>The material expression of this advantage always is a
Feint by a Kindred Corps against a vital point either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
occupied or unoccupied, which necessitates that upon his
next move, the enemy either evacuate, support, cover or
sustain the post so menaced.</p>

<p>Such feint, therefore, restricts the move of the enemy
to those of his corps as are able to obviate the threatened
loss and proportionately reduces the immediate activity
of his army.</p>

<h4>RELATIVE ADVANTAGES IN LOCATION</h4>

</div>

<p class="hanging"><i>The distance which separates opposing Corps d’armee
always modifies the values of the Prime Strategetic Means.</i></p>

<p>Hence in the making of Grand Reconnaissance, it is
next in sequence to determine whether the Chess-pieces
are:</p>

<ul>
<li>I. In Contact.</li>
<li>II. In Presence.</li>
<li>III. At Distance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Corps d’armee are <i>in Contact</i> with each other whenever
their logistic radii intersect; or, their radii offensive and
the corresponding adverse radii defensive are opposed
to each other.</p>

<p>Corps d’armee are <i>in Presence</i> whenever the posts
which they occupy are contained within the same Strategic
front, the same Strategetic Horizon, or are in communication
with their corresponding posts of mobilization,
development, or manoeuvre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Corps d’armee are <i>at Distance</i> when the posts which
they occupy are not in communication with Kindred
Corps d’armee posted upon the strategic front adopted,
or with posts of mobilization or development contained
within the corresponding Primary Base of Operations,
or, within the True Strategetic Horizon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<h4>REQUISITES FOR SUCCESSFUL
CAMPAIGNING</h4>

<p>Every Campaign, whether upon the surface of the
Earth or upon the Chess-board is decided and usually is
terminated by a Grand Battle.</p>

<p>Those movements of opposing Grand Columns, whereby
such decisive conflict is brought about under circumstances
which ensure victory, by reason of superior
advantages in Strategetic Means, are termed Grand Manoeuvres;
and a proper series of Grand Manoeuvres, combined
with their corresponding feints, strategems, ambuscades
and minor battles, the whole terminated by a
resulting Grand Battle, is termed a Grand Operation.</p>

<p>Those processes of Grand Manoeuvre, which produce
an opportunity to victoriously engage in battle, are the
most subtle and difficult known to the Strategetic Art.</p>

<p><i>Successful application of these processes in practice depends
wholly upon proper use of the MEANS at hand
and the doing of the utmost that can be done in the TIME
available.</i></p>

<p>Nothing can be more repugnant to high art in Strategetics
than those crudities termed in the specious mouthings
of pretentious mediocrity “waiting moves,” “delayed
strokes,” “defensive-offensives,” “masterly inactivities,”
and the like.</p>

<p>“Time past is gone and cannot be regained; time future
is not and may never be; time present is” and with it
Opportunity, which an instant later may be gone.</p>

<p>The gain of but “a foot of ground and a minute of
time” would have saved the French army at Rosbach
and have cost Frederic the Great one of his most lustrous
victories and perhaps his army and his crown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>In Strategetics there is but a single method whereby Opportunity
may be availed of, and that is by so augmenting kindred
advantages and so depreciating adverse advantages as to
acquire for the kindred army that particular advantage of
Strategetic means which in the given situation is the proper
basis of the Strategetic movement next in sequence.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4><i>At Distance.</i></h4>

<p class="hanging"><i>The chief requisite for success when acting against an
adverse army at Distance, is the advantage in MOBILITY.</i></p>

<p>The primary process is that of a Grand Manoeuvre
against an adverse army acting in the formation by
Grand Columns, and the object of such Grand Manoeuvre
always is, by superior celerity of movement, to occupy:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. The Strategic Center by the Kindred Column of
Attack, thus intersecting the Route of Communication
between the adverse main body and its Base of Operation;
or to occupy:</li>
<li>2. The Logistic Center with the Kindred Columns of
Support and of Manoeuvre, thus intersecting the Route
of Communication between the adverse main body and its
Chief Supporting Column and clearing the way for the
advance of the Kindred Column of Support against the
flank and rear of the adverse Main Body.</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, the united Kindred Columns of Attack
and of Support always will constitute an overwhelming
superiority in Numbers as compared with the adverse
main body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>In Presence.</i></h4>

<p class="hanging"><i>The chief requisite for success when acting against an
adverse Grand Column in Presence, is the advantage in
POSITION.</i></p>

<p>The primary process is that of a Grand Manoeuvre
against an adverse army acting in the Formation by
Wings, and the object of such Grand Manoeuvre always
is, by availing to the uttermost of its situation upon the
Tactical Center, <i>i.e.</i>, upon the area midway between the
adverse Wings thus isolated from each other; to act in
overwhelming Numbers, first against one and then
against the other hostile bodies.</p>

<h4><i>In Contact.</i></h4>

<p class="hanging"><i>The chief requisite for success when acting offensively
against an adverse Grand Column, or Wing, or Corps
d’armee, in Contact, is the advantage in NUMBERS.</i></p>

<p>The primary process is that of a Grand Battle in
which the kindred army has an overwhelming superiority
in Numbers in contact, and at least the equality in all
other Prime Strategetic Means.</p>

<p>In this circumstance, the object of such Grand Battle
always is:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. To attack the hostile Formation in Mass frontally
at the center, and upon both wings obliquely; all three
attacks being made simultaneously and the evolutions so
executed that the hostile army never is able to penetrate
between either kindred wing and the kindred center, nor
to outflank that kindred wing which may be in the air.</li>
<li>2. In case the kindred army has the equality or
inferiority in all other Prime Strategetic Means, then the
object of a Grand Battle on the Offensive is to attack the
hostile Formation in Mass obliquely with the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
kindred army, and preferably upon that wing which covers
the route of communication of the adverse army with
its Base of Operations, but always upon that wing which
contains the Tactical Key of the actual Battlefield.</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, the concentration of the entire kindred
army against a single adverse wing always will constitute
an overwhelming superiority in Numbers.</p>

<p>In making such attack obliquely against a single adverse
wing, the center and remaining wing of the kindred
army must not engage until the kindred Van and Corps
of Position of the attacking wing first have formed the
<i>center</i> of three sides of an octagon; of which the Kindred
Corps of Evolution will form the <i>farthest</i> side and the
Kindred Center and left wing Corps d’armee will form the
<i>nearest</i> and latest constructed side.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="hanging"><i>The chief requisite for success when acting defensively
against a Grand Column, or Wing, or Corps d’armee is the
advantage in TOPOGRAPHY.</i></p>

<p>The primary process is that of a Grand Battle in which
the kindred army, decidedly inferior in Numbers in the
aggregate, has the advantage in Topography and equality
in all other Prime Strategetic Means.</p>

<p>In this case the object is to support both flanks of the
inferior army upon impassable natural barriers, strengthening
both wings at the expense of the center, both in
quantity and in quality of troops.</p>

<p>If the Tactical Defensive be selected, the center should
retire before the oncoming of the hostile army in order
to enclose it between the Kindred Wings, which will
then overwhelm it by superior Numbers, while the natural
barriers on the flanks being impassable will prevent the
remaining hostile corps from participating in the battle
otherwise than as spectators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Should the Tactical Offensive be selected, that kindred
wing best adapted for attack should engage supported
by all kindred Corps of Evolution, while advancing the
Kindred Center in reserve and holding the remaining
wing refused and in observation.</p>

<p>All else being equal, relative advantage in either
branch of Prime Strategetic Means is sufficient to ensure
victory in battle, and the proper use of such advantage
for securing victory is outlined thus:</p>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>Utilize advantage in Prime Strategetic Means to obtain
the superiority in Numbers at the Point of Contact in an
Offensive Battle; and to nullify the adverse superiority in
Numbers at the point of contact in a Defensive Battle.</i></p>

<p>Between War and Chess there is a seeming incongruity,
which is the basis of that doubt of the utility of Chess-play,
so commonly held by laymen, and which fallacy
few, even among proficients, are competent to combat.</p>

<p>This doubt most frequently is voiced by the query:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If Chess and War are analagous, why was not Napoleon
a Master Chess-player and Morphy a great military
Commander?</p>

</div>

<p>This query readily is answered in the words of Frederic
the Great, viz.:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To be possessed of talent is not sufficient. Opportunity
to display such talent and to its full extent is
necessary. All depends on the time in which we live.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>The Strategetic talent possessed in common by Morphy
and Napoleon, in both was brought to perfection by
long and expert training.</p>

<p>But circumstances placed the twelve year old Napoleon
in the midst of soldiers and in an era of war, while circumstances
placed the twelve year old Morphy in the
midst of Chess-players and in an era of Peace.</p>

<p>Napoleon was educated a General; Morphy was educated
a lawyer.</p>

<p>To develop his self-evident and superlative Strategetic
talent, Napoleon’s education was of the best; to develop
his self-evident and superlative Strategetic talent, Morphy’s
education was of the worst.</p>

<p>Napoleon succeeded as a General; Morphy failed as a
lawyer.</p>

<p>The innate capability of Napoleon for Strategetics was
developed in the direction of Warfare; the innate capability
of Morphy for Strategetics was developed in the
direction of Chess-play.</p>

<p>In War, Napoleon is superlative; in Chess, Morphy is
superlative.</p>

<p>Educated in the law, Napoleon might have proved like
Morphy a non-entity; educated in Chess, Napoleon
might have proved like Morphy a phenomenon.</p>

<p>Educated in War, Morphy might have rivalled Napoleon.</p>

<p>For the Chess-play of Morphy displays that perfect
comprehension of Strategetics, to which none but the
great Captains in warfare have attained.</p>

<p>Perfection in Strategetics consists in exactly interpreting
in battle and campaign, the System of Warfare
invented by Epaminondas.</p>

<p>Those able to do this in War have achieved greatness,
and the great at Chess-play are those who best have
imitated that exactness with which Morphy employed
this system on the Chess-board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>To those who imagine that Strategetic talent, as exemplified
in Warfare, is different from Strategetic talent as
exemplified in Chess-play, the following may afford
matter for reflection.</p>

<h2>PRIME STRATEGETIC PROPOSITION<br />
<span class="smaller">SECTION ONE</span></h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">First Phase.</span>)</h3>

<p>In the consideration of every Strategetic Situation
possible in Warfare, or in Chess-play, the initial process
always is a Grand Reconnaissance.</p>

<p>Grand Reconnaissance is that exact scrutiny of existing
conditions, whereby is determined the relative advantages
and disadvantages possessed by the opposing armies in:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Time.</li>
<li>2. Numbers.</li>
<li>3. Position.</li>
<li>4. Organization.</li>
<li>5. Mobility.</li>
<li>6. Topography.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>First Phase</i> in the demonstration of every Prime
Strategetic Proposition consists:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. <i>In determining by comparison of the relative advantages
and disadvantages in Time, which of the opposing
armies has the ability to MOVE, while the other must remain
stationary.</i></li>
<li>2. <i>In deducing the MOTIF of such movement.</i></li>
<li>3. <i>In designating the DIRECTION of such movement.</i></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>The making of Grand Reconnaissance is a special
privilege which exclusively appertains to the advantage
in <i>Time</i>. It always should be made by the Commander-in-chief
of that army which is able to put itself in motion,
while the opposing army must remain stationary, and
it never should be confounded with the advance of the
Cavalry Corps, nor confused with the work of scouts and
spies; all of which are matters entirely separate and
distinct from Grand Reconnaissance.</p>

<p>In the Grand Reconnaissance of any given Strategetic
Situation the element of Numbers <i>primarily</i> is to be
considered, for the reason that the basic fact of the Science
of Strategetics is:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>“THE GREATER FORCE ALWAYS OVERCOMES
THE LESSER.”&mdash;Napoleon.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Hence, unless more immediately vital considerations
prevent, superiority in Numbers, of itself, is <i>decisive</i> of
victory; and thus it readily is to be deduced that all
else being equal, the advantage in Time plus the advantage
in Numbers constitutes the easiest and simplest
winning combination known to Strategetic Art.</p>

<p>But it so happens that the advantage in Time may be
combined not only with the greater force, but also with
an equal, or even with the lesser force, and from this it
is self-evident that Strategetic Situations are divided
into three classes, viz.:</p>

<ul>
<li>I. Numerical superiority, plus right to move.</li>
<li>II. Numerical equality, plus right to move.</li>
<li>III. Numerical inferiority, plus right to move.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are <i>two primary methods</i> for availing of superiority
in Numbers to destroy the opposing lesser force, viz.:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<ul>
<li>1. <i>By the Process of Attrition, i.e., by maintaining
an incessant tactical offensive and thus wearing down the
opposing army by exchanging pieces at every opportunity.</i></li>
<li>2. <i>By Acting in Detachments, i.e., by means of the
extra corps, simultaneously to attack more points of vital
importance than the hostile army is able simultaneously to
defend.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>From the foregoing it is obvious that conversely there
are two principal considerations, which all else being
equal, must dominate the procedure of the Numerically
inferior force, viz.:</p>

<ul>

<p>The <i>second consideration</i> in the making of a Grand
Reconnaissance by the commander-in-chief of an army
having the advantage in Time, is the element of <i>Position</i>;
for the reason that by unscientific posting of Corps
d’armee, relative advantages in Time, or in Numbers or
in both, may be rendered nugatory, on account of inability
of the kindred Columns of Attack, of Support and
of Manoeuvre to perform their functions.</p>

<p>In case the Corps are scientifically posted and are in
positions to avail of advantage in Time and Numbers,
those adverse vital points whose occupation may be
effected by superior force, always will be the objectives of
the movements of the latter.</p>

<p>Hence, the following:</p>

<h3>PRINCIPLE</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>As the advantage in Time gives the right to MOVE and
the advantage in Numbers indicates the MOTIF of movement;
so does the advantage in Position, as expressed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Strategic Syllogism, specify the DIRECTION of that
movement which normally appertains to the army having
the advantage in Time.</i></p>

<p>The proper <i>direction</i> of that movement which normally
appertains to the advantage in Time always is indicated
by the plus signs in the Strategic Syllogism, viz.:</p>

<h3>THEOREM</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>Given the Normal ability to move, to determine the
Normal motif and direction of movement.</i></p>

<p>1. Designate that army having the advantage in
Time and express such advantage by the symbol +T,
express the corresponding disadvantage in Time which
appertains to the opposing army, by the symbol -T, and
such symbols will constitute the First Term of the First
Phase of the demonstration of any Prime Strategetic
Proposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Express that superiority, equality, or inferiority
in Numbers, which appertains to each of the opposing
armies by the symbols +N, =N,-N, respectively;
and such symbols will constitute the Second Term of
the First Phase of the demonstration of any Prime
Strategetic Proposition.</p>

of any Prime Strategetic Proposition.</p>

<p>4. Combine those three terms which appertain to the
advantage in Time, then combine those three terms
which appertain to the disadvantage in Time, and the
resulting equation when expanded will depict:</p>

<ul>
<li>(a) The normal ability to move.</li>

<p>Hence, in the foregoing example the normal direction
of movement for White may be either toward the Objective
Plane with the Column of Attack, or toward the Logistic
Horizon, or the Point of Junction with the Column of
Support, or toward both objectives, with both columns
simultaneously.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Black army having the disadvantage
in Time is unable to move, and consequently is stationary.</p>

<p>Furthermore, White having the superiority in Numbers
may move with an equal force against either objective
designated by the Third Term of the equation, and with
his excess force against one or more adverse vital points,
simultaneously, against which latter movement, Black
obviously has no adequate defence.</p>

<h4>(<i>First Phase.</i>)</h4>

<p>Let the term +A in its degree represent the relative
advantage in Position of the Column of Attack; +S in its
degree the relative advantage in Position of the Column
of Support, and +M in its degree the relative advantage
in Position of the Column of Manoeuvre; let equality
in Position of the several Columns be represented by the
terms =A, =S, =M, and let inferiority in Positions of
the several Columns be represented by the terms -A,
-S, -M, and let those terms appertaining to the White
Columns be written above a line and those terms appertaining
to the Black Columns be written below the line,
and let that collection of terms containing the plus and
equal signs of greater Strategetic value be the Major

<p>Let the ability to move while the opposing force must
remain stationary be represented by the term +T, and
let the converse be represented by the term -T, and let
superiority in Numbers be represented by the term
+N; the equality in Numbers by the term =N, and inferiority
in Numbers by the term -N, and let the combining
of any form of the terms T and N constitute a
<i>Tactico-Logistic Inequality</i>.</p>

<p>Let any combination of that Strategic Syllogism which
appertains to a given Strategetic Situation with the
corresponding Tactico-Logistic Inequality, form the
<i>Initial Strategetic Equation</i>.</p>

<p>Let the plus terms and the equality terms, which are
contained in the Initial Strategetic Equation, be expanded
into their highest forms according to the table of
Strategetic Values, and annex to each of such terms that
numeral which expresses the relative rank of such term
in those calculations which appertain to the pending
Prime Strategetic Proposition.</p>

<p>Compare the values so obtained and let the highest
<i>Strategetically</i> be regarded as the menace most immediately
decisive, then:</p>

<p>If the term +T appertain to the Piece operating such
menace, let such Piece be regarded as the Corps d’armee
en Menace, and the Objective of such menace as the
Prime Decisive Point; the occupation of such Point by
such Piece as the Normal Motif of Offensive Effort, and
the Logistic Radius connecting the Point of Departure
occupied by such Piece and the Prime Decisive Point as
the Normal Direction of Offensive Effort.</p>

<p>If the term +T does NOT apply to that menace which
combined with the term +T would be most immediately
decisive, then:</p>

<p>By further comparison of the terms of the Initial
Strategetic Equation, select that Decisive Menace strategetically
next in sequence to which the term +T does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
appertain; and let the Piece operating such Decisive
Menace be regarded as the Corps d’armee en Menace;

Point; the occupation of such Point by such Piece as
the Normal Motif of Offensive Effort, and the Logistic
Radius connecting the Point of Departure occupied
by such Piece and the Prime Decisive Points as the
Normal direction of Offensive Effort.</p>

<p>Provided:</p>

<p>Whenever the term +T appertains to a Menace not
so immediately decisive as another menace operated by
an adverse army, column, wing or corps d’armee, but
to which the term +T does <i>not</i> appertain, then: the
Normal motif of Effort is <i>defensive</i>, and the Normal
direction of Defensive Effort is along the Logistic Radius
between the Point of Departure of that Kindred Piece,
which by the advantage of the term +A, is able to nullify
the adverse most immediately Decisive Menace and

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
